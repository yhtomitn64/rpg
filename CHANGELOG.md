# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), with a
lightweight versioning scheme suited to a solo personal project (no
public API, no formal release process — commits land straight on
`main`):

- **Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.** Stay in `0.x` during early
  development.
- **MINOR** bumps for a completed feature/build (new content, new
  systems) — one bump per finished design-doc/plan under
  `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- **PATCH** bumps for bug fixes, balance tweaks, and small polish that
  aren't their own feature.
- **1.0.0** is reserved for when the game feels like a complete,
  coherent experience — explicitly including the story (see
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`, author-written, not AI-generated), not
  just an accumulation of systems.
- Entries land under `## [Unreleased]` while in progress and move into
  a dated version section once the work is done and committed — there's
  no separate release step to wait for.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.34.5] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **The player's own marker no longer inherits guardian/boss scale when
  standing on a guardian or boss tile.** `js/screens/mapDomRenderer.js`
  (line 269) and `js/systems/mapDrawList.js` (line 213) each set the
  marker to `GUARDIAN_PX` (2.2x tile size, "big and scary" per the
  0.26.12 comment) whenever `tile === TILES.guardian || tile ===
  TILES.boss`, with no guard excluding the player's own marker - unlike
  the neighboring `PORTAL_ACTION_TILES` check a few lines below in both
  files, which already carries `&& !isPlayer` for the same reason. Both
  conditions now add `&& !isPlayer`, so walking onto (or fighting on) a
  guardian/boss tile keeps the hero at normal `HERO_AND_LOOT_PX` size
  instead of ballooning to guardian scale; the guardian/boss glyph
  itself is unaffected when the player isn't standing on it. Diagnosed
  pre-split against `js/screens/mapScreen.js` (see the now-fixed
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md` entry raised 2026-09-09) - this applies
  the same one-line-per-file fix to both files that split off from it.

## [0.34.4] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **`js/screens/battleScreen.js`'s Lacerate retrigger window now reads
  `Date.now()` instead of `performance.now()`**, matching every other
  elapsed-time read in the same file (windup start/complete, parry
  cooldown, buff durations) - no comment anywhere explained why this one
  mechanism used a different clock, and a ~1.2s UI timing window has no
  real use for `performance.now()`'s extra precision or clock-adjustment
  immunity. This was the one thing blocking the last 6 subtests in
  `tests/battleScreenDom.test.js` from converting to `t.mock.timers`
  (confirmed no newer Node version adds `performance` support to
  `mock.timers` either - checked the current docs) - all 89 subtests in
  that file now run on the fake clock. That file: ~9s -> ~2s.

## [0.34.3] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **Two more real-wall-clock waits converted to `t.mock.timers`**, the
  small remainder found while auditing the suite after 0.34.1/0.34.2:
  `tests/celebrationEffect.test.js`'s tool-celebration-duration test
  (1500ms + 1400ms real wait) and `tests/mapScreenDom.test.js`'s two
  portal-pull-delay tests (500ms each). Both were simple, single
  `setTimeout` calls in application code (no `Date.now()` reads, no
  chaining), so this was a direct swap. Doesn't change the full suite's
  wall-clock time - `node --test` runs files concurrently, and these
  waits were already shorter than `battleScreenDom.test.js`'s own
  runtime (the actual bottleneck, ~7.6s of it the six Lacerate-
  retrigger-window tests still deliberately on real timers - see
  0.34.2's own entry) - but removes their own residual CI-load-flake
  risk regardless.

## [0.34.2] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **`tests/battleScreenDom.test.js` converted from real wall-clock waits to
  `node:test`'s `t.mock.timers`**, the same fix 0.34.1 already applied to
  `tests/battleSpecialAttacks.test.js` (`docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`) - this
  file was 42+ of the suite's ~43 real seconds (89 subtests, most polling
  real time for `js/screens/battleScreen.js`'s real `setInterval(tick,
  300)`), the same CI-parallel-load starvation risk. Runtime: ~42s -> ~9s.
  Six Lacerate-retrigger-window subtests are deliberately left on real
  timers - that mechanism is timed off `performance.now()`, which
  `mock.timers` doesn't support mocking on this Node version (confirmed by
  direct experiment). `battleScreen.js` itself is unchanged. Also added
  `.github/workflows/test.yml`, a tests-only PR workflow with no deploy
  step, so the suite can be re-run against GitHub's own runner (where this
  class of flake actually shows up, not a local machine) as many times as
  needed to build confidence before merging, without repeatedly deploying
  to production the way re-running `deploy.yml` would.

## [0.34.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **`tests/battleSpecialAttacks.test.js` flaked under CI's parallel test
  load, blocking this deploy** (`docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`, raised
  2026-09-10, flaked again today past a prior fix's 20000ms deadline).
  The test's own `an unparried cooldownOverload special disables an
  off-cooldown ability button` polled real wall-clock time waiting for
  `js/screens/battleScreen.js`'s real `setInterval(tick, 300)` to fire -
  under CI's CPU contention from ~74 test files running concurrently,
  that timer itself gets scheduled late, and raising the poll's deadline
  (twice now) only bought margin, not a fix. Rewrote the file onto
  `node:test`'s built-in `t.mock.timers`, so `tick()` only ever fires
  when the test explicitly advances a fake clock - no real waiting, no
  CI-load dependency, and the file now runs in well under 1 second
  instead of 20-40+ real seconds. `battleScreen.js` itself is
  unchanged. Also fixed a genuine, unrelated hazard the deterministic
  ticks exposed: an occasional monster critical hit for exactly the
  player's starting 20 HP could end the battle mid-test, since these
  tests now reliably drive the monster through multiple attack turns
  instead of racing a poll that used to often return early - the
  player's HP in this file's fixtures is now effectively unkillable,
  since survival odds were never what these tests are checking.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- **Worn paths now reduce the wild-encounter chance on that tile, up to
  50% less at full wear** - raised and designed live the same day (see
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-worn-path-encounter-discount-
  design.md`). The discount multiplier tracks the existing visual
  trail-wear curve exactly (`trailWearFraction`/`TRAIL_WEAR_CAP = 10` in
  `js/systems/trail.js`, new `wornPathEncounterMultiplier`) - Timothy's
  own call, so a heavily-trafficked tile can reach the full 50% off
  within its first 10 crossings. `js/screens/mapScreen.js`'s encounter
  roll now folds this multiplier into the existing
  `Math.random() < encounterChance` comparison, reading the tile's visit
  count from *before* the current step (a never-before-walked tile gets
  zero discount on the step that first walks it). Deliberately no
  per-screen aggregate cap and no NG+ tempering - both explicit calls,
  not gaps; trail/visit data already carries across NG+ resets
  (`js/systems/ngPlus.js`), so this is now a real, deliberate gameplay
  effect there too, not merely cosmetic as the old comment claimed.
  On by default with a new Settings toggle
  (`state.settings.wornPathDiscountEnabled`), plus a one-time in-game
  hint banner the first time the discount actually applies to a step,
  using Timothy's own wording. A ring/charm idea that would suppress
  encounters entirely was designed alongside this (composes
  multiplicatively, doesn't replace the case for the per-tile discount)
  but is not built - see `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`.

## [0.33.3] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **The dragon boss entrance rendered on a black square at plain tile size**,
  raised 2026-09-12 with a screenshot. `TILES.boss` (`js/tiles.js`) was the
  one landmark tile missing from both `FULL_SQUARE_MARKERS` and
  `GRASS_CONTEXT_MARKERS` (`js/systems/mapRenderModel.js`) - every tool
  guardian and the superboss entrance/marker were already in both sets, so
  it alone fell through to `.map-tile`'s bare default background
  (`GROUND_COLOR_DEFAULT`, `#333333`) and the plain `FULL_SQUARE_PX` size
  instead of grass and the "big and scary" `GUARDIAN_PX` (2.2x) treatment
  guardians get. Timothy: "this dragon should not have a background and be
  4x the size like the tool bosses." Added to both sets, plus the
  `GUARDIAN_PX`-sizing check and the always-on-top z-index boost (needed
  since the oversized sprite now bleeds into the row below, same as a
  guardian) - all four spots, canvas and DOM renderers alike. New coverage
  in `tests/mapDrawList.test.js` and `tests/mapScreenDom.test.js` against
  `js/maps/dungeonMap.js`'s real boss tile.

## [0.33.2] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- **Map stayed blurry after closing a dialog (battle, inventory, settings -
  anything mounted through `screenManager.js`'s `mountOverlay`), raised
  2026-09-12.** Timothy: "the backgrouns stayed blurry after a battle," then
  independently guessed the real cause while I was still chasing it live:
  "wonder if it's because I was playing with browser built-in zoom." He was
  right. `js/screens/mapCanvasRenderer.js` only ever re-checked
  `devicePixelRatio` in `renderStep()` (needs a real step) - `mapScreen.js`'s
  `pause()`/`resume()`, which fire around *every* dialog, only ever
  toggled keyboard listeners and never touched the renderer. A zoom change
  made while any dialog sat on top left the static-layer cache (and the
  canvas's own backing store) rasterised at the old ratio until the
  player's next literal footstep - which for a screen you'd just resumed
  into could be a while. The devicePixelRatio check is now its own function
  (`syncDprIfChanged`), called from both `renderStep()` and a new
  `refreshViewport()` that `resume()` calls unconditionally. Couldn't get
  a visual repro in an automated browser session - genuine browser zoom
  isn't reachable from page JS, and the closest analogs (overriding
  `window.devicePixelRatio`, the non-standard CSS `zoom` property) either
  don't affect real rendering or don't move the property at all - but the
  gap itself was confirmed directly by reading the code, independent of
  reproducing it.
- **Minor wording fix**: the 0.33.1 player-changelog entry called the
  portal emoji (🌌) "swirling" - it's a starry sky, not a swirl (🌀 is
  already Momentum Elixir's icon). Corrected the text only, no version
  bump of its own.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-09-12

### Changed
- **Named the four superboss-drop items** that shipped as placeholders in
  the 0.28.0-era superboss pass (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-
  superboss-pass-design.md` explicitly left this to Timothy). `Ferocity
  Fang` is now `Tooth Flooth` - his 4-year-old's name for it, kept because
  it fits: the weapon has no attack stat at all (pure `lifestealPercent`/
  `critChancePercent`), so even at apex tier + max upgrade the biggest
  number on it is still small. `Parry Master Ring`, `Unshaken Charm`, and
  `Stormring of Haste` already read as real names, so they just lost the
  `[PLACEHOLDER NAME]` tag. `superBossOne`'s own name is still a
  placeholder - not touched this pass.
- **Removed the portal tile's drop-shadow effect** (`.map-tile-portal`
  in `css/styles.css`, the `portalShadow` draw-list op in
  `js/systems/mapDrawList.js`/`js/screens/mapCanvasRenderer.js`). It was a
  deliberate design (iterated live with Timothy back when it shipped, see
  the CSS comment above `.map-tile-portal-crop`), but read as a plain
  black square in practice rather than a soft bleed - raised 2026-09-12:
  "the portal background being a black square ... just use the emoji, no
  background under it." The 🌌 emoji's own oversized-and-cropped rendering
  (unrelated, hides its baked-in pale border) is unchanged.
- **Removed the border around the battle screen's pause button**
  (`.battle-pause-btn` in `css/styles.css`), raised 2026-09-12 - just the
  emoji on its dark background now.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **Static-layer cache for the map renderer.**
  Timothy reported frame drops walking on heavily-walked ground at a
  large window, recovering on untrodden ground. Measured first: at a
  maximised window over fully-walked ground the map cost 7.70ms of JS
  and 46,668 canvas ops per frame; the worn trail was ~92% of every draw
  call, all of it rebuilt and repainted every frame for content that
  only changes when the player steps on a tile. Ground, trail and static
  sprites now paint once into an offscreen canvas blitted with a single
  `drawImage`; the live layer is the hero, the effects, and the cells
  whose own content animates.
  - **The cache is patched, not rebuilt.** Rebuilding it once per step
    measured well on a per-frame average and was horrible to play:
    it turned evenly-spread work into one enormous paint every 110ms,
    a ~9Hz spike. Timothy, on that build: "it's really really choppy in
    the outside world ... in town is smooth but outside world with all
    those paths is pretty bad." A step changes exactly two tiles, so
    `patchStaticCache` repaints only those. The correctness trick is a
    clip: redraw a region LARGER than the dirty area (so every
    neighbour that paints into it is present, in row-major order) while
    clipping to the dirty area itself (so nothing outside is touched).
    Margins come from the draw list's own numbers, not a guess - the
    tallest obstacle reaches 0.275 of a tile up, a signpost label 0.32,
    and guardians are zBoosted so they never sit in the cache at all.
  - **Measured, maximised window over fully-walked ground: 7.70ms ->
    0.68ms of JS and 46,668 -> 1,552 canvas ops per frame** (11x and 30x).
    The headline result is that window size stops mattering: maximised
    now costs the same as a normal window (0.68ms vs 0.67ms), where
    before it cost 4x more. Anything that does not name its changed
    tiles still falls back to a full repaint, so a missed patch can
    never leave stale pixels on screen.
  - **The cache scrolls rather than rebuilding when the camera leaves
    it.** Walking off its edge used to cost a full repaint; the average
    absorbed that but it was plainly felt - "it does do the 12 step
    hitch though and it's very noticable". `scrollStaticCache` now
    copies the still-valid pixels to their new offset (double-buffered,
    the two canvases swapping roles) and repaints only the one or two
    thin strips that just came into range, through the same clipped path
    an ordinary patch uses. A scroll now costs about what a step costs.
  - **`?staticCache=off`** paints every cell live again, exactly as the
    renderer did before the cache. Kept deliberately: the cache's whole
    risk is drawing something subtly *differently*, and a switch that
    toggles it on one running page is the only honest way to settle
    "is this artifact the cache, or was it always like that". The flag
    resolves onto the render context (props beat the URL, matching how
    `renderer` already works) rather than being read off `location` -
    the first version read the global, which left the branch impossible
    to test, and it shipped referencing two variables in their temporal
    dead zone: it threw every frame and painted the map solid black.
    `tests/mapStaticLayer.test.js` now drives both paths through the
    real frame loop.

### Fixed
- **`?debug=stress` generated a world the game cannot produce**, which
  briefly looked like a renderer bug. Each tile picked its crossed edges
  from a hash independently, so a tile could draw a trail stroke toward
  a neighbour that drew nothing back and the stroke stopped dead at the
  tile boundary - reported, reasonably, as "path having square edge when
  dark/thick meets either thin/light or non-existing path". Real play
  cannot do this: a step records both halves of the crossing it makes
  (`markDirection` on the tile left, `markVisited` with the opposite
  direction on the tile entered). Edges are now decided per edge rather
  than per tile, so both sides always agree, and
  `tests/debugCharacters.test.js` asserts it across all 25 screens.

### Fixed
- **Obstacle canopies and signpost labels were being erased near the
  player** — a bug in the first cut of the cache above, found by
  Timothy on the live build, not by the suite. That version also kept a
  3x3 block around the player out of the cached layer and repainted it
  every frame; repainting a cell repaints its ground, and that ground
  erased anything overhanging *into* the block from outside it. Two
  symptoms, one cause: "when I'm above a tree then a tall tree below
  that one gets cut off" (obstacles are bottom-anchored and bleed
  upward), and "the shop sign goes away when I'm in its 3x3 square",
  with the quest board's plank vanishing from exactly three tiles north
  of it (a sign label draws *entirely* in the row above its own tile).
  - Enlarging the block would only have moved the seam outward: a
    sub-rectangle of an interleaved-paint-order scene cannot be redrawn
    over a cached whole without losing the overhang from outside it.
    The player's cell never needed to be live at all — the hero is a
    `followsHero` op, which `paint()` already holds back and draws after
    every tile. The cache now keeps every ordinary cell.
  - `tests/mapStaticLayer.test.js` asserts the invariant that was
    missing: an ordinary cell may never appear in the live layer.
    Verified to fail with the bug reintroduced.

### Added
- **`?debug=stress` test character**, at Timothy's request while
  checking the above: level 20, fully equipped and strong enough to
  ignore anything in the way, every quest at a turn-in-ready count, a
  placed portal, and the whole 5x5 wilderness cluster covered in worn
  path at all ten wear levels with a mix of dead ends, corners and
  four-way junctions. Banded rather than uniform on purpose — stroke
  width scales with visit count and adjacent tiles average their widths,
  so a uniform fill would exercise exactly one width and none of the
  blending. Really a rendering stress fixture that happens to be a
  character.

## [0.32.5] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **The project's name was "Emoji RPG" everywhere, locking in an art style that might not
  stay emoji-only forever.** Renamed to "RPG" in the GitHub repo (`emoji-rpg` → `rpg`),
  `package.json`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the in-game title (`index.html`,
  `js/screens/startScreen.js`). Left unchanged on purpose: the live domain (already
  `rpg.burghertime.com`), the Cloudflare Pages deploy target
  (`--project-name=emoji-rpg` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — a separate internal
  identifier; renaming it risks having to redo the custom domain binding for no benefit),
  and the `emoji-rpg-*` localStorage keys (save/slots/telemetry — renaming those would
  silently orphan existing players' save data under the old key).

## [0.32.4] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **The residual walk micro-stutter, in both the map and the character.**
  Raised by Timothy: "I am wondering if we can take another stab at
  making the character walking perfectly smooth with no microstutter. It
  seems to me both the map and character are a little stuttery and maybe
  the issue is we need to tie it all together." That last guess was
  right, and it was a *third* clock nobody had looked at. 0.32.2 put the
  walk cadence and the hero's stride on one clock; the camera was still
  on its own.
  - **What was wrong.** The camera aimed at `computeViewportOrigin`,
    which is computed from the hero's *logical tile* — so its target
    jumped a whole tile the instant a step landed. The camera's
    exponential ease then sprinted right after each step and crawled
    just before the next one: a ~9Hz surge, once per 110ms step, for as
    long as a direction was held. The hero's own stride, meanwhile, is
    deliberately *constant* speed (see `computeHeroStep`'s header for
    why). Two different velocity profiles for the same motion, and what
    the eye actually sees is the difference between them — the character
    sliding back and forth on screen while the ground scrolls unevenly
    underneath. Both halves had been measured separately before and each
    looked fine on its own; the composite — the hero's position *on
    screen*, which is `hero - camera` — had never been measured at all.
  - **The fix.** A new `computeCameraOrigin` (`js/systems/world.js`) is
    the same camera placement as `computeViewportOrigin` but centred on
    a *fractional* tile, and `mapCanvasRenderer.js` points the camera at
    the hero's interpolated position through it instead of at the
    logical tile. The target now moves at the same constant speed the
    hero does, so the camera settles to a constant lag and a constant
    velocity. `frame()` also had to be reordered — the hero advances
    first and the camera then aims at where the hero *now* is, rather
    than at where they were last frame.
  - **Measured, per this loop's standing rule** (see BACKLOG.md's
    "Micro-pause once per step" entry, where simulation once overturned
    the plan). Over 20s of held-key walking at the default glide, per-
    frame spread of the hero's on-screen position went 2.80px → 0.18px
    and of the map's scroll 3.10px → 1.33px against realistic frame
    jitter; against clean vsync both go to exactly **0.00**, i.e. every
    frame moves the map the identical distance. The remaining jittered-
    case spread is the injected dropped frames themselves, not
    unevenness the code adds.
  - **A candidate was measured and rejected**, which is why the two rAF
    loops are still two loops: driving the hero's sub-tile position
    straight off the walk accumulator's own phase (removing the stride's
    arrival clamp entirely) scored *identically* to the camera coupling
    alone at every glide setting. The arrival clamp simply isn't a
    material term once the camera is coupled, so the coupling between
    input and renderer that BACKLOG.md's "Residual walk micro-stutter"
    entry warned about buys nothing and wasn't taken.
  - **The canvas renderer's `frame()` now has integration coverage at
    all**, which it never had: jsdom returns null from
    `getContext('2d')`, so the loop no-opped out on its first line in
    every existing test. `tests/mapWalkSmoothness.test.js` gives it a
    recording stub context and a hand-driven animation-frame *queue*
    (a single-callback stub silently drops one of the two competing rAF
    registrations, and the character never takes a second step), then
    asserts the real loop's camera against the real walk loop's steps.
    Verified to fail — 8.7px/frame of hero wobble — with the coupling
    reverted.

## [0.32.3] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Dragon gear and Unique-effect items could never be reforged to Mythic.**
  Raised live: "why can't I reforge dragon stuff and some other things to
  mythic?" Two older, separate design decisions had collided with the
  newer Superior→Mythic reforge system without anyone revisiting them:
  bosses were entirely excluded from the normal Plain/Fine/Superior/Mythic
  roll (their named drop instead had its own flat 25%-Mythic-or-nothing
  NG+-only mechanism, `BOSS_MYTHIC_CHANCE`, now removed), and Unique-effect
  items (Vampiric Fang, Swift Strike Charm, Ember Ring, Keen Eye,
  Retribution Charm, Windfury Ring) never rolled a tier at all by original
  design ("uniques aren't tiered - they ARE the rare tier"). Since reforge
  strictly requires a Superior-tier item, neither category could ever
  reach it. `js/systems/loot.js`'s `rollDrop` now runs both through the
  same toughness-weighted roll as everything else - a boss's xp clamps to
  the top of the difficulty curve (same odds as the toughest regular
  monster), so no special-casing was needed. Once one of these items lands
  Superior, the existing Smith reforge option just works.

## [0.32.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **The micro-pause once per step while walking.** Raised by Timothy
  after the smooth stride landed: "there is a micro pause but we can
  commit this then chase that." Two clocks disagreeing — steps fired on
  a `setInterval` while the hero's stride advanced on animation-frame
  deltas, and a timer is a floor rather than a target (never early,
  usually a few ms late), so the stride finished first and the hero
  stood still until the step caught up. Landing that gap on a frame
  boundary duplicates a frame, which is what the pause was. Steps now
  accumulate frame time, so step and stride cross their thresholds on
  the same frame and cannot drift apart.
  - **The candidates were simulated before one was picked, and the
    measurement overturned the plan.** `computeHeroStep` is exported, so
    20s of held-key walking against realistic timer jitter can be
    replayed offline. Exponential smoothing scored *best* on frozen
    frames but far worst on the spread of per-frame movement (1.32
    against 0.07) — it avoids freezing by lurching, which is its own
    stutter, and the obvious single metric would have picked it. Frozen
    frames went 1.5% → 0.5%, movement spread 0.17 → 0.07.
  - Catch-up is capped and any backlog past it is dropped, so a hidden
    tab or a stalled thread can't cash out as a burst of queued steps.
  - **Residual left alone deliberately.** `mapScreen`'s walk loop and
    the renderer's draw loop are separate `requestAnimationFrame`
    registrations, so within one frame a step can land either side of
    the hero advance — uneven, though never a frozen frame. Removing it
    means coupling input to the renderer. Timothy on the remainder:
    "isn't a huge deal ... don't really notice/bother me."

### Changed
- **The character no longer keeps walking while the tab is in the
  background** with a direction still held. Falls out of the change
  above for free: a background tab stops firing animation frames, where
  the old `setInterval` kept ticking (throttled) the whole time.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **`tests/battleSpecialAttacks.test.js` no longer fails under a loaded
  test runner.** Not a product bug - the test was timing-fragile and CI
  is slower than a dev machine.

  **Correction to this entry as originally written** (2026-09-10, same
  day): it claimed 0.30.0 and 0.31.0 "were both committed to `main` but
  never went live, so the site kept serving the 0.29.0 canvas-renderer
  build", and that this release unblocked them. That overstated it. Both
  of those deploys *did* fail - 0.30.0 on the `Unreleased` gate, 0.31.0
  on this test - but 0.32.0's run then went green and carried all three
  live, minutes before this fix was pushed. The status report this entry
  was written from was accurate when sent and stale by the time it was
  acted on. So the flake was intermittent (it failed CI twice in a row,
  then passed), not a hard block, and this release hardened a test that
  was going to keep costing random deploys rather than rescuing a stuck
  pipeline. Caught by a concurrent session that had watched the 0.32.0
  run itself.
  - The stun test waits on a *log line* and then asserts *live* button
    state four statements later, so under contention the 300ms `tick()`
    could expire the fixture's 3000ms stun in between; `updateMenu()`
    re-enabled Attack and the assertion failed with "Attack should render
    disabled while playerStunDebuff is live". That fixture's `durationMs`
    is now 30000 - deliberately longer than `waitForCondition`'s own
    timeout, so the window always outlasts the worst-case wait rather
    than merely being bigger. Nothing in that test asserts the stun
    expires, so a wider window costs it nothing.
  - `waitForCondition`'s default timeout goes 5000ms → 20000ms. It's a
    *failure deadline*, not a wait - the loop returns the moment its
    predicate holds, so a green run never spends it. Found while checking
    the above: the `cooldownOverload` test timed out at 5336ms on one run
    of this file and passed on a re-run, i.e. a second instance of the
    same fragility that hadn't been reported yet.
  - The two `slow` tests in the same file were left alone deliberately -
    they only assert append-only log text, so debuff expiry can't affect
    them.
  - Verified with three consecutive full-suite runs (1181/1181).

  Diagnosis and the initial report came from two concurrent sessions
  hitting this from different directions; the CI-failing case was
  reported as reproducing on two consecutive runs while passing locally.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Holding two perpendicular directions walks the staircase for you.**
  Raised by Timothy: "if you hold down up/right or up/left can the
  character go that direction... it seems it can't handle two keypresses
  at once." Then, crucially, on being shown what diagonal movement would
  cost: "I don't even care if the character can travel diagonally, I
  actually like that they have to go up and then right. I just want to be
  able to hold both keys to make the game do that."
  - That reframing removed the entire problem. A true diagonal step
    crosses a tile *corner*, and the worn-path trail only knows the four
    edge directions — so diagonals would have needed corner-directed
    strokes, a shared-jitter rule for corners (a corner touches four
    tiles, not two), and new tests, or else diagonal routes would have
    rendered as disconnected dots. Alternating two cardinal steps
    instead keeps every step a single cardinal move, so collision,
    screen-crossing and the trail all work untouched. **No change to
    `trail.js` at all.**
  - Walking into an obstacle with both keys held doesn't halve your
    speed: a look-ahead (`canStepToward`, no side effects) spends the
    tick on whichever direction is actually open. Two opposing keys
    resolve to the most recently pressed rather than deadlocking.

### Changed
- **Holding a direction now walks at a fixed cadence instead of the
  browser's key auto-repeat.** Raised: "if you hold down
  up/left/right/down it's kind of janky and not smooth... if you hold
  down character should walk fast just smoothly." Auto-repeat is an OS
  setting — it waits roughly half a second before starting, then fires
  at whatever rate that machine is configured for, so a held key gave
  one step, a pause, then a machine-dependent burst, and travel speed
  was never the same for two players. `event.repeat` keydowns are now
  ignored outright and a 110ms cadence owned by `mapScreen.js` drives
  the repeat. Keys are tracked as held from keydown to keyup, and
  released on window blur (alt-tabbing away delivers no keyup, which
  would otherwise leave the character walking on its own) and on
  `pause()` (so an encounter firing mid-walk doesn't leave the map
  walking underneath the battle overlay).
- **The character now walks smoothly between tiles** rather than
  jumping a whole tile at a time — "the character seems to snap between
  squares. Can they go smoothly too just like the map does now?" Their
  logical position stays a whole tile (collision, trail and encounter
  rolls are all defined on the grid); only the drawing interpolates.
  Deliberately a constant speed matched to the walk cadence rather than
  the camera's easing — an ease would restart on every tile and read as
  fast-slow-fast-slow instead of one unbroken walk.
- **The camera-glide default is now 250ms** (was 80ms), and the slider
  reaches 400ms so the default no longer sits on its own maximum. A save
  still holding the superseded 80ms is moved up to the new default —
  that was the default for less than a day, so those saves have almost
  certainly never had the slider touched; any other value is treated as
  a real choice and left alone. `0` still means the pre-canvas instant
  snap, for both camera and character.

### Fixed
- **The character was being sliced in half while walking**, which read
  as blinking in and out — caught by Timothy on a screen recording.
  Hero sprites were drawn in row-major order at their *logical* tile but
  positioned at their *interpolated* one, so mid-stride the overhang
  landed on a tile painted later, whose ground fill covered it. Walking
  up or left hit it every time, and two-key walking sends half its steps
  upward. Hero sprites now draw in a final pass. Tradeoff taken
  deliberately: a tall obstacle in the row below no longer paints over
  the character's feet, which the row-based depth sort used to arrange —
  losing sight of your own character behind a tree is the worse of the
  two.
- **The terrain juddered under a gliding camera** — "map kind of herky
  jerky now too." Ground tiles were rounding their position to whole
  pixels (an over-eager attempt at avoiding seams between them) while
  trees, flowers, the trail and the character all drew at fractional
  positions, so the whole ground grid snapped along a 1px lattice
  underneath smoothly-moving sprites. The 1px overlap is what actually
  prevents seams; the rounding only did harm.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Sound variants.** A sound id can now have several recorded takes and
  playback rotates between them, instead of firing the same file every
  time — `hitNormal` and `walking` repeat constantly, and one sample on
  a loop is the classic giveaway. Declared in one place
  (`SOUND_VARIANTS` in `js/data/soundManifest.js`: the sound id and how
  many takes exist), with files named `<soundId>.mp3`,
  `<soundId>-2.mp3`, … so adding a take is a number bump plus dropping
  the file in — no other code change. New `resolvePaths()` returns every
  take (always an array, single-take sounds included) alongside the
  existing single-path `resolvePath()`. `playSfx` picks per play and
  never repeats the same take twice in a row: with only 2-3 takes, an
  unguarded random pick collides often enough to undo the point. Buffer
  cache is keyed per variant.
- **First real audio in the game.** 21 generated clips wired up as
  `assets/audio/realistic/sfx/`: the basic attack hit (2 takes), Impale
  (4), Sever (3), Lacerate (8), Faultline's cast (2) and its per-enemy
  impact, plus a battle-start stinger. Generated locally with Stable
  Audio 3 Small SFX and chosen by ear in the audition tool; a new test
  fails the build if `SOUND_VARIANTS` ever promises a take with no file
  behind it, since that failure mode is otherwise silent (one warn, then
  the sound just doesn't play).
- **`abilitySweepImpact`**, Faultline's own per-enemy impact sound.
  Faultline resolves as a staggered walk across every living enemy
  (`SWEEP_STAGGER_MS`, 260ms apart), so its impacts need to be shorter
  and more brittle than the general-purpose `hitNormal` thud or
  consecutive hits smear into each other. `playHitEffect` takes an
  optional `impactSoundId` override for this; crits still play
  `hitCrit` either way so a crit keeps reading as a crit.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **Group encounters can now resolve before the battle dialog opens**,
  same as solo ones always could. Raised 2026-09-10: "I think we should
  make it so we can auto kill groups of enemies too." New
  `resolveWeakGroupEncounter`/`isGroupOutclassed`
  (`js/systems/combat.js`), with `resolveWeakMobEncounter` kept as the
  one-element case so nothing else had to change. **Every** monster in
  the group must be outclassed (one dangerous straggler makes the fight
  worth opening), and one trigger roll + one outcome roll cover the whole
  pack rather than rolling per monster - so a four-mob group is exactly
  as likely to skip the dialog as a solo mob, and there's no partial
  "two of the three ran away" state. The other gates are untouched:
  bosses and `forceFullBattle` guardians are still exempt, still ≤ 3
  hits-to-kill, still a 35% trigger.
  - Found while wiring it: the `fled-with-loot` branch in `js/main.js`
    read `encounterMonsterIds[0]` alone, which would have quietly paid
    out a single monster's loot for a fleeing pack of three. It loops the
    whole roster now. (`surrender` already looped, so it needed no
    change.)
- **The monster flee animation is much slower and more visible**
  (`playMonsterFleeEffect`, `js/screens/mapScreen.js`). Raised
  2026-09-10: "slow down the animation when they enemies fly away and
  make them slowly get bigger as they fly spinning away so you really
  see it." 700ms → 2000ms, travel 120px → 220px, and it now **grows** to
  2.6x while spinning 3 turns instead of shrinking to 0.3x with no
  rotation - so the emoji reads as tumbling toward the viewer rather
  than dwindling away. Spin direction is randomized per monster, and a
  fleeing group staggers 120ms apart so they don't leave as one clump.
  - The fade is deliberately held off until the last third: a
    `easing` passed in the *options* object remaps overall progress
    before keyframe offsets are looked up rather than easing each
    segment, and a first cut with a strong ease-out there measured 44%
    opacity only 800ms into the 2000ms flight - visually over before it
    was half done. Options easing is `linear` now, with per-keyframe
    easing on the outward drift instead. Verified by seeking the
    animation: fully opaque through 1200ms while growing 1.0 → 1.7x,
    then fading across the last 800ms.
- **The battle screen scales down to fit instead of overflowing the
  window on big group encounters.** Raised 2026-09-10 with a screenshot:
  "when there are lots of enemies the whole battle screen too big. maybe
  make it wider or just make sure it scales to fit?" - the ability
  buttons were half cut off and the `s`/`a`/`Spc`/`i`/`f` hotkey row
  below them was clipped away entirely, which matters because that row
  is how you parry and flee.
  - Cause: `--battle-scale` (`css/styles.css`) ramped the whole card
    *up* to 1.7x from a `100vmin` term, while a big group independently
    wrapped `.battle-monster-row` onto extra lines and made it taller -
    the two compounded, since a transform can't know how tall its own
    content got. That rule's comment already conceded the footprint "can
    still exceed the viewport" and left `#overlay`'s scrollbars as the
    safety net, which isn't a usable answer for a real-time battle.
  - Fix: the vmin ramp is now only a ceiling, capped via CSS `min()` by
    `--battle-fit-scale` - measured from the card's real untransformed
    `offsetWidth`/`offsetHeight` by `fitBattleScaleToViewport`
    (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) and recomputed on window resize.
    Measured deliberately rather than via `getBoundingClientRect`, which
    would feed the previous scale back in and compound on every resize.
    A no-op under jsdom (which reports 0 for both), so it doesn't affect
    the DOM tests. Verified live at 12 monsters: the card wanted 1948px
    in a 1255px viewport before the cap and now lands at 1231px with the
    full hotkey row on screen; at 2 and 6 monsters the fit factor stays
    above 1.7, so ordinary encounters render exactly as before.

### Added
- **XP progress now shows in the top HUD bar** - a short progress bar
  plus `current/needed`, sitting after Lv./HP/Gold (`renderHud`,
  `js/main.js`), with a `title` tooltip giving the exact remaining
  amount. Raised 2026-09-10: "I know it's in the stats screen but maybe
  something a bit more visible somewhere too." Reads the same
  `xpForLevel` (`js/systems/leveling.js`) the Stats screen has always
  used, so the two readouts can't disagree. The element is nested inside
  the existing Lv./HP/Gold span rather than appended to `#hud` directly
  - `#hud` is a `space-between` flex, so a new direct child would get
  spread across the bar instead of sitting with the other numbers.
- **Settings > Display > "Show XP progress in the top bar"** toggles it
  (`state.settings.showXpInHud`, default on). New `DEFAULT_HUD_SETTINGS`
  + `migrateHudSettings` (`js/state.js`), merge-only in the same shape as
  `migrateAudioSettings`, so a save where it's already been turned off
  never gets switched back on at load. Deliberately a plain Display
  section above "🚧 Feature Flags" rather than inside it: this is
  finished behavior a player might just not want on screen, not a beta.
  Settings' `onChange` in `js/main.js` now also calls `renderHud()`, so
  flipping it takes effect immediately behind the still-open overlay.

### Changed
- Backlog: logged two threads raised the same session - the battle
  screen overflowing the viewport on large group encounters (ability bar
  and hotkey row clipped), and the scope of the pre-fight instant-resolve
  path (`resolveWeakMobEncounter`), including a write-up of its four
  existing gates since "not sure the logic on that" was half the ask.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **The map now renders to a `<canvas>` instead of a CSS Grid of ~1200
  `<div>` tiles.** Panning a large wilderness screen still visibly
  hitched after two earlier perf passes, and six further hypotheses were
  each tested live in Chrome DevTools and ruled out one at a time — the
  cost tracked the camera transform itself, not any content around it
  (`Painting: 1,666ms` vs `Scripting: 395ms` over one range). A step now
  costs one bitmap paint of viewport size no matter how far the camera
  moved. Scope is only the map's tile rendering; HUD, battle, overlays
  and the start screen are untouched DOM/CSS.
  - Architecture: `js/systems/mapDrawList.js` turns the visible world
    into an ordered list of draw ops (pure data — no DOM, no canvas),
    and `js/screens/mapCanvasRenderer.js` paints it. That split is why
    the renderer is testable at all: jsdom has no canvas, but the draw
    list is plain numbers.
  - Emoji come from a glyph atlas, rasterised once per emoji at a high
    base size and scaled per draw — keyed by emoji alone, never by size,
    which is what makes the randomised obstacle sizes free rather than
    an unbounded number of atlas entries.
  - Paint order reproduces the old row-based `z-index` scheme exactly:
    row-major, then a second pass for portals and guardians. Obstacle
    canopies still bleed upward, guardians still bleed all four ways.
  - Deliberately canvas2d, not WebGL or an engine — ~900 sprites/frame
    is well inside budget, and WebGL has no path API, which would make
    the trail harder rather than easier.
- **The worn-path trail was ported as a transcription, not a rewrite.**
  The draw list carries `trail.js`'s own numbers in its own 0..100
  coordinate space, and the painter's single scale by
  `TILE_SIZE_PX / TRAIL_VIEWBOX_SIZE` is the only unit conversion
  anywhere, so nothing can drift. `createLinearGradient` maps onto the
  old `<linearGradient>` and `quadraticCurveTo` onto the old `Q` command
  one-for-one. New `tests/mapTrail.test.js` locks down the properties
  every past trail bug violated — that two tiles sharing an edge agree
  on its color, its width and its jitter — which the SVG version never
  had coverage for. Confirmed live on a real save: a tile at full wear
  and its barely-walked neighbor both land on `#575931` at their shared
  border, at matching width.
- **Map effects are now canvas-native tweens** (`js/systems/mapEffects.js`)
  rather than CSS keyframes: level-up pulse and rays, well-heal ring and
  glow, portal pull. One animation system instead of a CSS/JS split, and
  effects can depth-sort against tiles (the rays really do sit behind
  the hero). `playMonsterFleeEffect` deliberately stays a `document.body`
  element — it's meant to fly outside the map viewport, which a canvas
  draw would clip.
- **Tile descriptions on hover** are drawn by hand now, since canvas has
  no `title` attribute — the pointer is hit-tested back to a world
  coordinate and only updates when the tile under it changes.
- `js/screens/celebrationEffect.js` asks `mapScreen.getPlayerScreenRect()`
  for the hero's position instead of reaching in with a
  `.map-tile-player` querySelector, which only the DOM renderer ever
  produced.
- **The old DOM/CSS-Grid renderer's own code moved verbatim** into
  `js/screens/mapDomRenderer.js` behind a small renderer interface,
  rather than being deleted outright - still reachable via
  `?renderer=dom` below for a live A/B on one save. Constants both
  renderers need (tile/marker sizing, obstacle and landmark sets, ground
  colors, trail direction bookkeeping) now live in one shared
  `js/systems/mapRenderModel.js` rather than being duplicated per
  renderer where they could drift. `connectorPathD` (`js/systems/trail.js`)
  split into `connectorPathPoints` (the raw curve control points) plus a
  formatter over it, so the canvas renderer feeds numbers straight into
  `quadraticCurveTo` instead of building an SVG path string only to parse
  it back apart - `trail.js`'s existing tests assert the exact output
  string and pass unchanged, which is what proves that split faithful.

### Added
- **Smooth camera panning, with a "Map camera glide" slider in
  Settings** (0–250ms, default 80). The canvas camera is a real pixel
  offset, so it can interpolate between tiles instead of jumping a whole
  tile per step. **0 reproduces the old instant tile-snap exactly**, so
  the slider spans "how it used to feel" through to a visible glide. The
  camera hard-snaps if it ever falls more than ~1.5 tiles behind, so
  holding an arrow key can't let the hero outrun the view.
  - Caught by Timothy before this shipped: the slider had no visible
    effect at any setting, always snapping instantly. Cause: the render
    loop resets its own elapsed-time tracking to 0 whenever it goes idle
    between steps, so the very first frame of every step's camera move
    measured a 0ms delta — and that 0ms case was folded into the same
    branch as "too far behind, snap immediately." Since an ordinary step
    only moves the camera ~1 tile, that frame-0 snap always finished the
    whole move before any frame with a real delta ever ran, so the
    exponential glide was live code that could never actually execute.
    The camera's decision logic (`computeCameraStep` in
    `mapCanvasRenderer.js`) is now a pure function with its own test
    file (`tests/mapCamera.test.js`) that drives it through exactly this
    idle→step→idle sequence with controlled timings, rather than relying
    on watching a real browser animate — real animation frames turned
    out to be unavailable in this project's own automated browser
    session (Chrome suspends `requestAnimationFrame` entirely for a
    tab whose OS window isn't focused), the same class of limitation
    that already applies to DevTools performance profiling here.
- `?renderer=dom` temporarily restores the old DOM renderer, so both can
  be compared live on the same save in one build. Removed together with
  `js/screens/mapDomRenderer.js` once canvas is confirmed better.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Ring smith-upgrades, and a second Charm (accessory) slot.** Raised live:
  "what do I need to upgrade dragon scale mail?" led into "can we implement
  ring upgrades and better ring drops right now" and "also we should have
  two charm slots."
  - **Ring upgrades**: rings had no smith-upgrade material at all before
    this (`js/screens/smithScreen.js`'s old `hasUpgradePath` dead-branch,
    flagged but deliberately left as a content decision in
    `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`). New material **Moonstone Shard** 🌙
    (`upgradeSlot: 'ring'`, dropped by direWolf/Mega Muffin at 15%) covers
    both physical ring slots - `js/systems/inventory.js`'s `upgradeItem` (and
    the smith screen's material picker) now match a material against the
    *equipped item's slot type*, not the raw physical slot key, the same
    fix that made the eventual two-charm-slot split below drop straight in
    with no extra plumbing.
  - **Better ring drops**: `RING_TOUGHNESS_FLOOR` (`js/systems/itemQuality.js`)
    lowered 0.6 → 0.3 - a real ring (Ember Ring) was previously unreachable
    below dungeon-tier monsters; now the far-corner roster (direWolf/spider/
    scorpion) can drop one too.
  - **Two Charm slots**: the single `accessory` equipment slot is now
    `accessory1`/`accessory2` ("Charm 1"/"Charm 2" in the Smith/Stats/
    Inventory screens), mirroring the existing ring1/ring2 split.
    `migrateAccessorySlots` (`js/state.js`) moves an existing save's charm
    into `accessory1` and carries over its tier. Shop equip-prompt/"already
    equipped" logic (`js/screens/shopScreen.js`) now resolves dual-slot
    items (ring *and* charm) by physical slot instead of indexing
    `state.equipment` by the item's slot *type* - a latent bug for charms
    specifically once the single slot split in two, caught while making
    this change (rings already had it, unaffected in practice since Power
    Ring was the only ring ever sold).

## [0.27.4] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **Timed buff potions now last 20s instead of 12s** (all 8 of them -
  `buffDurationMs` in `js/data/items.js`, the single source of truth
  `js/systems/buffPotions.js` reads). Raised this session: 12s felt too
  short. Two things made it short in practice: Super Scream's free,
  cooldown-gated ability buff runs the same 12s
  (`js/systems/abilities.js`), so a consumed 30-40g potion bought no
  more uptime than a reusable ability; and the quick-select overlay runs
  at 25% time scale rather than a full pause, so a slice of the duration
  burns down during the selection itself. 20s clearly outlasts the
  ability buff and covers most of a fight while still expiring inside
  one battle, so it can't outclass earned gear (the concern recorded in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-buff-potions-design.md`). One-shots
  (Berserker Tonic, Second Wind) are unaffected - they have no duration.
  Spec's roster table and the duration assertions in
  `tests/buffPotions.test.js`/`tests/battleScreenDom.test.js` updated to
  match.

## [0.27.3] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **"Sell Duplicate Gear" now also sells whole lower-tier stacks of the
  same base item once you own or have equipped a strictly better tier of
  it** - not just excess copies within one tier, which is all it did
  before. Raised same session: "when you sell duplicate items also
  automatically sell old stuff that is worthless because you have better
  versions." A lower tier is protected from the sweep if it's already at
  this NG+ cycle's smith-upgrade cap while the better tier isn't (a maxed
  weak copy can out-perform an unmaxed strong one, per the tier/upgrade
  multiplier stacking) - keeps it until the better tier catches up.
  Comparison stays strictly within the same `itemId` (e.g. Iron Helm
  tiers vs. each other) - never across different base items sharing a
  slot (Iron Greaves vs. Wind Greaves), which don't strictly dominate one
  another. New `hasDuplicateGearToSell`/`itemPowerFactor` helpers in
  `js/systems/inventory.js`; the button's disabled state now reflects
  single obsolete copies too, not just same-tier excess.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- **Import from Code on the Character Select screen**, not gated behind
  `cloudSaveBeta` (that flag lives on a character's own save data, which
  doesn't exist yet at this screen) - raised same session: "someone
  doesn't have to start a new character just to import their other one."
  Reuses `loadByCode` (`js/systems/cloudSave.js`); wiring shared with
  Settings' own cloud-save import via one `handleCloudSaveImport`
  function in `js/main.js` rather than duplicated logic.
- **Every character now carries a stable `characterId`** (`js/state.js`,
  `crypto.randomUUID()`, migrated onto existing saves via
  `migrateCharacterId`) that travels with it through cloud-save
  export/import. Raised same session: "what if you import characters
  with the same name? how do we know it's the same character." Importing
  a code whose `characterId` matches a slot already on this browser now
  offers to overwrite that exact slot in place instead of blindly
  creating a duplicate; declining (or no match) falls through to naming
  a new slot as before, where typing a different name than the suggested
  default is the "rename" option.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **Map panning is meaningfully faster, continuing the 0.26.13 follow-up.**
  `mapScreen.js`'s grid placement (`grid-column`/`grid-row`) is now a pure
  function of world coordinate, anchored to the current screen-cluster's
  own bounds rather than the panning viewport - a cell's position never
  changes just because the camera moved, only the actual content around
  it does. Panning is now a single `transform: translate()` on the whole
  grid. Measured live in Chrome (Event Timing API, real steps
  dispatched): ~2.77ms/step -> ~1.05ms/step at a normal window size,
  ~4.69ms/step -> ~1.46ms/step maximized - the old code scaled worse with
  window size, the new one barely moves. See
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s "Map render performance" sections for
  the full diagnosis, six further hypotheses that were tested live and
  ruled out, and why a canvas-based rewrite is likely the next real step
  if fully smooth panning across large open wilderness screens is the
  bar (this fix alone doesn't fully get there).
- **Fixed a real forced-synchronous-layout bug found via a live DevTools
  recording** (its own Insights panel flagged it directly): `renderStep()`
  re-measured `viewportEl.clientWidth`/`clientHeight` on every single
  step, which forces the browser to synchronously flush layout right
  after the previous step's DOM mutations. The viewport's pixel size only
  actually changes on a real window resize, already handled separately by
  `handleResize()`'s own `resize` listener, so `renderStep()` now reuses
  the last-measured tile count (`computeStepGeometry()`) instead of
  re-measuring every step.
- `onMove` no longer calls `persist()` (a synchronous `localStorage`
  write) on every single step - `schedulePersist()` batches rapid
  movement into one write after 400ms of no further movement, flushed
  immediately on `visibilitychange`/`pagehide` so nothing is lost to a
  closed tab. Every other save trigger (purchases, quest turn-ins, map
  transitions, switching characters, etc.) still writes immediately,
  unaffected.

### Fixed
- `resolveStaticFilePath` (`tools/dev-server.mjs`) failed its own
  path-traversal check on Windows whenever `rootDir` used forward
  slashes (including its own test fixture) - `path.normalize` always
  backslash-normalizes on Windows, but `rootDir` was compared
  un-normalized, so every request looked like a traversal attempt and
  404'd. `rootDir` is now normalized once at the top of the function.

### Dev tooling (local-only, no player-facing change)
- `tools/dev-server.mjs` now sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` for JS/CSS,
  mirroring the production `_headers` rule (same 2026-08-29 incident that
  rule exists for), so local testing has the same explicit
  no-stale-code guarantee.
- A `?noEncounters=1` URL param (`debugCharacters.js`) skips random
  encounter rolls, for movement/perf testing without a battle
  interrupting every few steps - combinable with `?debug=<key>`.
- A small `localhost`-only badge (bottom-right) shows a hand-bumped
  `DEV_BUILD_TAG` so a local session can confirm which edit is actually
  loaded after a reload, rather than trusting a timestamp (which changes
  on every reload regardless of whether the code did).

## [0.27.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- **Cross-device save sync (Cloud Save), behind a new `cloudSaveBeta`
  settings flag, off by default.** Settings gets a "Start Transfer"
  button that generates a 4-character lowercase code and uploads the
  current character to Cloudflare Workers KV under it
  (`functions/api/save/code/[code].js`, `js/systems/cloudSave.js`); the
  code is shown with a live countdown and expires after 60 seconds
  (KV's own `expirationTtl`, its hard minimum) via a shared per-IP rate
  limiter (`functions/_shared/rateLimit.js`) - a deliberate one-shot
  transfer window rather than a standing address, since the code alone
  is deliberately low-security (no login). Typing a live code into
  another browser's "Load" field imports it as a brand-new character
  slot (`importSlot`, `js/systems/saveSlots.js`) alongside whatever's
  already there, rather than overwriting anything, so any number of
  browsers' characters can be pulled into one. Backed by a real
  `SAVES` KV namespace (`wrangler.toml`), created and verified live via
  a preview deploy (PUT/GET round-trip and the 60s expiry both confirmed
  against `https://preview-cloud-save.emoji-rpg.pages.dev` before this
  shipped to production).
- Removed the real AdSense publisher id from `ads.txt` (kept as an empty
  placeholder file, restorable from a comment inside it) - no AdSense
  integration is actually wired into the game yet, so there was no
  reason to ship a live publisher id.

## [0.26.14] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- The "you're right next to something you could clear with your X" gate
  proximity hint (`getGateProximityMessage` in `js/systems/toolGates.js`)
  used the generic verb "clear" for every tool, including the boat - which
  doesn't clear water, it crosses it. Now reuses the same
  `TOOL_CLEAR_VERBS` map `getToolClearedMessage` already had (axe: "cut
  through the thicket", miningPick: "clear the mountain", boat: "paddle
  across the water") so the hint and the after-the-fact success message
  agree.
## [0.26.13] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **Large/maximized browser windows dropped frames while walking, worse in
  Safari than Chrome.** `render()` (js/screens/mapScreen.js) did a full
  `rootEl.innerHTML = ''` teardown-and-rebuild of every visible map tile on
  every single step, and the number of visible tiles scales with window
  area (`computeViewportTileCount`) with no cap - a bigger window meant
  hundreds more tiles rebuilt per keypress. Split into `renderFull()`
  (mount/resize only) and a new `renderStep()` hot path that keeps the grid's
  DOM persistent and diffs by world coordinate, only touching cells whose
  content or on-screen position actually changed - most steps now update a
  handful of cells instead of every visible one. Also dropped `container-type:
  size`/`cqb` sizing on `.map-tile` (css/styles.css) in favor of plain px,
  since the tile pixel size (`TILE_SIZE_PX`) is a hardcoded constant that
  never actually varies - that per-tile layout containment was pure
  overhead. Noticeably smoother, though panning across a large open
  wilderness screen (as opposed to a small, non-panning one like town, whose
  whole cluster fits inside the viewport with no panning at all) still isn't
  fully smooth - each step still reassigns `grid-column`/`grid-row` on
  nearly every visible cell to reflect the pan, which still forces a
  layout pass across the whole grid even though no DOM nodes are
  created/destroyed anymore. Next step, not yet done: a `transform`-based
  camera that keeps each cell's grid position anchored to world
  coordinates (so panning is one compositor-only style write on the grid
  container, not a per-cell layout change).

## [0.26.12] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Tool guardian encounters (axe/pick/canoe/portal) had a gray box behind
  them instead of grass, rendered small, sat in a corner of their arena,
  and the arena itself was small.** `TILES.guardian` had never been added
  to `GRASS_CONTEXT_MARKERS`/`FULL_SQUARE_MARKERS` (js/screens/mapScreen.js)
  - same "landmark tile forgotten from the set" bug that's hit shop/smith/
    portals before, now fixed for guardians too. Also, per direct request
    ("make the tool bosses take up like 4 tiles instead of 1 so they look
    big and scary, in the center of their map instead of the corner, and
    make the map bigger"): the guardian now renders at 220% of a tile
    (`GUARDIAN_CQB`), bleeding into its four neighbors for a roughly-2x2
    footprint - reusing the same oversized-absolutely-positioned-span
    technique trees/mountains already use, so the guardian's actual
    walkable/action tile underneath is still exactly one cell, no
    collision changes. All four tool dungeon maps enlarged from 14x8 to
    21x13 (matching the game's own default viewport size) with the
    guardian moved to dead center instead of the old bottom-right corner.

## [0.26.11] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **superBossOne blocked the only crossing on `farSoutheast`, on the way to
  the pick tool.** Its entrance tile sat at (15, 20), the screen's one
  open east-west corridor into `southSoutheast` - since dungeon entrances
  teleport in on step with no confirmation, a player crossing that row had
  no way around a fight far above their level. Raised live, mid-
  playthrough at level 5: "it's in the path to get the pick and I can't
  get past yet, I'm too weak." Moved to (15, 9), an interior pocket on the
  same screen, off the through-corridor (`js/data/superBosses.js`).

## [0.26.10] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Shop/inventory/smith/quest board item tooltips: no stats shown on hover
  in the shop, and every screen's tooltip carried the browser's own
  unremovable hover delay.** Raised directly: "when I hover over items in
  the store it doesn't show any stats or what they do. Plus the store
  hover should be instant and no delay." Two separate bugs: (1) the shop's
  item cards split the emoji into its own untitled `<span>` - only the
  small name text beneath it carried a `title`, so hovering the big icon
  (the natural target) showed nothing; (2) all four screens relied on the
  native `title` attribute, whose hover delay has no CSS/JS override.
  Replaced `title` with a new shared instant tooltip
  (`js/screens/itemTooltip.js`, one delegated listener, `data-tooltip`
  attribute instead) across all four screens, and moved the shop card's
  tooltip onto the whole card so the emoji is covered too.

## [0.26.9] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **The Attack button's ready-ring closed and glowed as soon as the short
  swing cooldown ended, well before the attack was actually back to full
  damage.** Raised directly: "is the ring... actually at full power when
  the ring is full, or is it still under diminishing returns? We need to
  line up that effect with when it's actually at full power." It wasn't
  lined up - the ring shared the exact same `--pct` as the red cooldown
  wipe (`attackCooldownMsForStreak`, capped at a couple seconds even deep
  into a streak), while the actual damage-decay streak only resets after a
  much slower idle timer (`ATTACK_STREAK_RECOVERY_MS`, 8s of not pressing
  Attack). Added `attackReadyRingPct` (`js/systems/combat.js`) driven by
  that slower timer instead, and gave the ring its own `--pct` source
  (`readyRingPct` in `actionButtonHtml`) independent of the wipe's - the
  ring now only closes/glows once the next Attack will actually land at
  full strength.

## [0.26.8] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **The battle dialog wasn't vertically centered on windows wide/tall enough
  to trigger `--battle-scale` above 1x** (the 2026-09-05 "scale the whole
  battle dialog" feature). `#overlay` centers `.battle-screen-stack` while
  it's still its unscaled size, then `transform: scale()` grows it -
  `transform-origin: top center` anchored that growth at the box's top edge,
  so the scaled dialog grew only downward from the already-centered top,
  pushing its visual midpoint below the true center. Switched the anchor to
  `center` so growth is symmetric in all directions and stays centered on
  the same point #overlay centered the unscaled box on.

## [0.26.7] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **A mistimed click on a monster's ATB bar/parry hint forced its attack to
  resolve immediately, instead of missing cleanly like an early `s` press
  does.** Flagged in `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md` (raised 2026-09-05
  during the super-boss pass's final review) as a click/keyboard parry
  asymmetry that also now decides whether a super-boss's special attack
  lands, not just whether damage is reflected. Investigated with a jsdom
  repro rather than trusting the backlog's own framing: the actual root
  cause is narrower than "click-parrying is easier" - `resolveMonsterWindup`
  falls through to `monsterAttack()` on a failed zone check regardless of
  caller, but the keyboard path (`attemptParry`) only ever calls it after
  `resolveParryAttempt` has already passed, so a keyboard miss just leaves
  the wind-up to finish on its own. The per-monster ATB-bar/parry-hint click
  handlers called `resolveMonsterWindup` unconditionally, so a mistimed
  click forced that same failed-zone-check branch to fire right away.
  `attemptParryOnMonster()` (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) gives clicks the
  same pre-check-then-call shape as the keyboard path. Regression test in
  `tests/battleScreenDom.test.js`.
- **`tests/battleScreenDom.test.js` carried the same latent CI-flakiness
  pattern already fixed in `battleSpecialAttacks.test.js` (0.26.6).** Three
  tests waited a fixed guessed duration for a monster's wind-up to naturally
  resolve unparried, then checked the outcome once - flagged but not fixed
  in the 0.26.6 entry. Replaced with the same `waitForCondition` poll.

### Changed
- **Smith screen now shows the player's current NG+ cycle**, reusing the
  Stats panel's own `.ngplus-badge` - the upgrade cap shown on every slot
  is driven entirely by NG+ cycle, but nothing on the smith screen
  previously said what cycle was active. Surfaced 2026-09-07 while
  investigating an "old save has way more upgrade levels than expected"
  report that turned out not to be a bug.
- **Lacerate's retrigger buff and Super Scream's buff no longer look
  identical.** Both still just multiply attack damage via the same shared
  `buffState` - `activateBuff()` (`js/systems/abilities.js`) now tags it
  with a `source`, and the battle buff indicator swaps to Lacerate's own
  established red (already used by its claw/bleed decals) when that's the
  active source, instead of always showing the same amber "💪 Buffed" text.
  Icon/color only, no new flavor text.

### Infrastructure
- Deploy workflow: added `--commit-dirty=true` to the Cloudflare Pages
  deploy command, silencing wrangler's expected-but-noisy "working
  directory has uncommitted changes" warning (the `dist/` staging step
  always leaves untracked files right before this step runs).

## [0.26.6] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Flaky `battle special attacks` CI failures.** The 0.26.4 and 0.26.5
  deploys both failed `Run npm run test` on
  `tests/battleSpecialAttacks.test.js`'s cooldownOverload test - never
  reproducible locally in isolation, only under GitHub Actions' own load
  (every test file's real-wall-clock timers running in the same
  process). Root cause: three tests in that file waited a fixed
  `PARRY_WINDUP_DURATION_MS + 400` and then checked the outcome exactly
  once, racing the actual resolution under contention. Replaced with a
  `waitForCondition` poll (same technique `waitForWindupStart` in the
  same file already used) that waits for the real condition - the log
  line or button state - instead of guessing a duration, removing the
  race regardless of system load.

## [0.26.5] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Battle dialog snapping to its scaled size right after opening.**
  `.battle-screen-swirl-in`'s keyframes (`css/styles.css`) hardcoded
  absolute scale values (0.4 → 1.05 → 1) that ignored `--battle-scale`
  (0.26.2) entirely - a CSS animation takes over its animated property
  for its whole duration, so the entrance always swirled in toward plain
  `scale(1)` regardless of window size, then jumped straight to
  `.battle-screen-stack`'s own `scale(var(--battle-scale))` the instant
  the animation ended, with no transition between the two. Both
  `battle-screen-swirl-in` and the matching `battle-screen-swirl-out`
  keyframes now scale every stop by `--battle-scale`, so the swirl
  animates around the dialog's actual target size on both ends instead
  of always resetting to its unscaled one.

## [0.26.4] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Portal tile's white border.** The 🌌 emoji's own art is a framed
  picture with a pale border baked into the glyph, not CSS - the
  0.26.3 background glow read as fighting that border instead of
  hiding it. `.map-tile-portal-crop` (`css/styles.css`) now renders the
  marker oversized and clips it back to the tile's edge (scaled 1.36x,
  landed by eye in an interactive Artifact mockup,
  `docs/superpowers/scratch/portal-edge-lab.html`), so the border scales
  past the visible area instead of sitting on top of it. The old inset
  glow is replaced with a soft black shadow that bleeds outside the tile
  into its grass neighbors (`.map-tile-portal::before`, stacked
  `box-shadow` layers instead of a radial-gradient circle, since
  box-shadow naturally hugs the tile's own rectangle). Portal tiles also
  get a flat `+1000` z-index boost (`js/screens/mapScreen.js`) so that
  bleed reliably paints over every neighbor instead of only the ones
  above/left of it in the row-based depth sort.

## [0.26.3] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- **Portal trail-on-top bug and instant teleport.** `portalOrigin`/
  `portalReturn`/`portalDungeonEntrance` (`js/tiles.js`) were missing
  from `FULL_SQUARE_MARKERS` (`js/screens/mapScreen.js`), so the worn-
  path trail SVG always painted on top of the bare emoji instead of
  under it. Now rendered as a proper full-tile positioned marker, same
  as every other landmark tile. Stepping onto a portal action tile also
  no longer fires its callback in the same tick as the step - a new
  `.map-tile-player-portal-pull` animation plays on the player marker
  first (420ms, `PORTAL_PULL_EFFECT_MS`), with the actual
  `enterPortalToTown`/`enterPortalToOrigin`/`enterPortalDungeon` callback
  delayed to match. A `portalTransitionPending` guard blocks a second
  keypress from landing mid-pull.

### Added
- **Portal glow.** New `.map-tile-portal` background (dark radial
  gradient + slow pulsing indigo glow, `css/styles.css`) on all three
  portal tiles, replacing the plain `.map-tile` gray.

## [0.26.2] - 2026-09-06

### Changed
- **Battle dialog now scales with window size**: `.battle-screen-stack`
  (`css/styles.css`) gets a new `--battle-scale` custom property, a
  `clamp()` on viewport `vmin` ramping from 1x (today's exact current
  size, at or below a typical laptop window) to 1.7x (a large-monitor
  ceiling), applied via `transform: scale()`. Because CSS transforms
  compose, everything inside the dialog - hero/monster emoji, HP/ATB
  bars, action buttons, and every hit-effect decal's own
  `translate()`/`rotate()` - scales together with zero changes to the
  effects system itself. `#overlay`'s `overflow-y: auto` is now explicit
  `overflow: auto` as a scroll safety net for the rare near-square window
  where the scaled (transform, not layout-box) width could exceed the
  viewport. This is Option B ("everything scales together") from the
  "Battle Dialog Scale Lab" design artifact, resolving the
  "Bigger battle dialog" backlog entry
  (`docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`) - hero/monster stay in their existing
  vertical stack (hero below monster), per Timothy's answer that this
  pass shouldn't also change that layout.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-09-05

### Changed
- **Shop screen redesign**: `js/screens/shopScreen.js` now renders a card
  grid (bigger emoji per item) with Weapons/Armor/Potions category tabs
  and a single Buy button per item, instead of one long list of rows with
  up to four Buy-quantity buttons each. A shared 1x/5x/10x/100x qty toggle
  applies to every consumable's Buy button at once; gear still only ever
  buys 1 at a time regardless of the toggle (per the existing
  no-bulk-gear rule, raised 2026-08-29). This is Option A ("card grid")
  from the "Battle FX & Shop Lab" design artifact's section 05, the
  option marked Selected there - the mockup itself was never wired into
  the real game before now. Sell (including the Fine/Superior tiered
  sell rows) and the post-purchase equip prompt are unchanged.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **The super-boss system**, plus its first worked example. A new
  `js/data/superBosses.js` registry, two new wilderness tile kinds
  (`superBossMarker` for an open-world encounter, `superBossEntrance` for
  a superboss with its own dungeon) with their rendering/resolution
  wiring, and `main.js` tile-action handling for entering/exiting a
  superboss's own dungeon. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-superboss-pass-design.md`.
- **`superBossOne` [PLACEHOLDER NAME]** - the first hand-placed superboss:
  a 3000 HP / 55 attack / 24 defense encounter that only a fully-decked
  NG+ build (every slot Mythic-tier and maxed, both superboss-only rings)
  can realistically win, and even then not comfortably - tuned via
  `scripts/simulate-balance.js` to a real ~10% win rate / ~17% average
  HP remaining on a win / 6.0 of 6 potions used, well below the guardian
  pass's own 48-53% comfort band. Every lesser build tested loses
  outright. Fought behind its own small dungeon
  (`js/maps/superBosses/superBossOneDungeon.js`, two rooms and a
  corridor), entered from the far-southeast wilderness. Drops a
  guaranteed Apex-tier Ferocity Fang. First of ~10 planned - the rest are
  future content using this same system.
- A new monster special-attack system: `specialAttacks` (stun / slow /
  cooldown-overload), telegraphed through the existing parry wind-up - a
  successful parry negates the effect exactly like it negates damage, a
  missed one lets it land alongside the normal hit. New player-side
  slow/stun debuff primitives (`js/systems/combat.js`) and their
  tick/guard wiring in the battle screen support this; `superBossOne`
  above is the first (and so far only) monster that uses it.
- A new `apex` item-quality tier above `mythic` (placeholder name/value),
  and a `dropTable` entry can now carry an explicit `tier` field applied
  directly instead of randomly rolled - needed since a guaranteed
  superboss drop bypasses the random toughness roll entirely.
- 4 new unique-effect items for superboss guaranteed drops (placeholder
  names): 2 using new parry-window/debuff-duration stats
  (`parryWindowBonusPercent`, `debuffDurationPercent`), 2 at a higher
  ceiling than today's best (`emberRing`/`windfuryRing`).
- New map-editor tooling (`tools/terrain-painter/`) to author and place
  superbosses, used end-to-end to build and place `superBossOne` above: a
  "Place Super-Boss Marker" mode (same UX as the existing "Place Tool
  Dungeon Entrance"), a "New Dungeon" blank-canvas mode to paint a
  brand-new dungeon interior from scratch (using the `guardian` tile
  kind, not `boss`, which stays reserved for the one real dragon fight),
  and a small local Node authoring server (`tools/terrain-painter/
  server.js`, built-in `http`/`fs` only) that writes every change -
  including a brand-new dungeon file and its `main.js` registration -
  straight to disk in any browser, replacing the old
  `python3 -m http.server` + File System Access permission dance. Dev-only,
  never part of the deployed build.

### Changed
- Mythic-tier item drops are no longer flatly impossible before your
  first NG+ cycle - a small new pre-NG+ chance exists (~0.1-0.4% by
  monster toughness), and the NG+1+ band now scales up per cycle
  (×1.5/cycle starting at NG+2) instead of staying fixed at the NG+1
  numbers forever. `js/systems/itemQuality.js`.
- `scripts/simulate-balance.js` can now model a monster's special attacks
  (slow/cooldown-overload; stun remains a known unmodeled gap, noted in
  its own report output - the simulated player has zero reaction latency
  to begin with, so its numbers already read as systematically easier
  than real play) and is generic over any `isSuperBoss` monster, so
  `--set`/`--special-attack` work against a superboss's own matchup row
  automatically, the same way they already do for the dragon's tiers.
  Used to tune `superBossOne` above.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- The Portal Dungeon entrance is placed on the map for the first time
  (`southSouthwest`, tile 16,17 - `js/data/toolDungeons.js`'s
  `TOOL_DUNGEON_ENTRANCES.portal`, previously `screenId: null`, i.e.
  unreachable), placed via `tools/terrain-painter/`. Small island (grass +
  mountain) carved out of the surrounding lake so the entrance sits on
  walkable ground, and the mountain-wall divider through that stretch
  swapped to thicket. Completes the full tool progression end to end: town
  → axe → pick → boat → portal → dragon, all placed and reachable.

### Fixed
- `toolDungeonMaps.test.js`'s null-screenId invariant test no longer
  depends on some real `TOOL_DUNGEON_ENTRANCES` entry staying unplaced
  forever (it relied on portal being the last one) - now pins the same
  invariant down with a synthetic entry instead.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-09-05

### Changed
- Tool-dungeon guardians (Axe/Pick/Boat/Portal) and the Dragon got a real
  per-target-level tuning pass, replacing the same-night +50%-HP-only
  stopgap from 0.25.0: axeGuardian→L5 (260/34/10/9), pickGuardian→L7
  (320/42/13/10, no longer an identical twin of axeGuardian now that they
  target different levels), boatGuardian→L9 (420/56/18/11), portalGuardian→
  L10 (500/58/19/12, though its map entrance is still unplaced -
  `TOOL_DUNGEON_ENTRANCES.portal` - so this is inert for now), and
  dragon→L11 (600/58/22/13), the hardest of the five by design. Numbers
  came from a throwaway Monte Carlo script built on the real
  `js/systems/combat.js`/`abilities.js`/`parry.js` functions (same
  approach as `scripts/simulate-balance.js`), run against Timothy's own
  real telemetry gear at each target level, targeting ~48-53% average HP
  remaining for a well-geared player - a deliberately under-geared player
  at the same level now loses outright instead of scraping by. Reconciled
  the simulator itself against a real logged fight first: its damage math
  is byte-identical to the shipped game, but its simulated player has zero
  reaction latency (acts every single 300ms tick), making its own
  win-rate/HP-remaining/duration readout systematically optimistic vs.
  real play - accounted for by tuning well below what the simulator calls
  a "comfortable" result.
- `getBossTierStats`/`getNgPlusCombatOverrides` tests updated for the new
  dragon base stats (their own multiplier math is unchanged).

### Removed
- Mini-dungeons (the random cave rooms with a guaranteed gold+item
  treasure) no longer get discovered on new steps - "the random dungeons
  offering more gold is so silly... let's drop that mechanic for now."
  Gated behind a single `MINI_DUNGEONS_ENABLED = false` flag
  (`js/systems/miniDungeons.js`) rather than touching each wilderness map
  file's own `miniDungeonChance` - flip it back to `true` to fully restore
  the feature. Entrances already recorded on an existing save still work;
  this only stops new ones from appearing. The underlying cap/chokepoint/
  chance logic (`wouldRevealMiniDungeon`, split out from
  `shouldRevealMiniDungeon` for this) stays fully tested independent of
  the flag, so re-enabling it later isn't a leap of faith.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- Ability hit effects for Impale/Sever/Lacerate/Attack replaced the old
  traveling-glyph swing sprite with a decal drawn directly on the target,
  matching Attack's own earlier slash-mark approach - `playImpaleDecal`
  (two crossing strokes, four bigger/thicker ones on crit or while
  Faultline's widen buff is active), `playSeverDecal` (a curved arc, a
  second bigger one on crit/empowered), `playLacerateDecal` (three
  raking claw strokes plus falling drops, tying the visual to its own
  delayed bleed tick), and `playAttackImpact` (a shockwave ring,
  replacing the white slash mark Attack briefly had). `swingKeyframesFor`/
  `swingSpriteEmoji`/`SWING_DURATION_MS` removed - Sweep keeps its own
  traveling-sprite system unchanged. `tools/animation-lab/` is left as-is
  for now, disconnected from these four abilities.
- Extra-target hits (Sever's own bonus target, or any ability widened by
  Faultline's buff) now land `EXTRA_TARGET_STAGGER_MS` (140ms) apart with
  their own swing effect, instead of resolving instantly with only a hit
  flash and no swing at all.
- Attack's own action button gets an always-visible SVG "ready ring"
  (`actionButtonHtml`'s `readyRing` option) that traces itself in as its
  cooldown counts down, closing into a full glowing loop exactly when
  it's usable again - the four abilities already had their own
  cooldown-wipe/retrigger-glow signal, Attack didn't.
- Spamming Attack now also floors the shared ability GCD (not just
  Attack's own already-growing cooldown) via a new
  `attackStreakGcdBonusMs` growth term - previously a player could spam
  Attack at full speed while still firing an ability the instant its own
  cooldown expired, undercutting the GCD's own point.
- The hero's own battle emoji renders as a flat grayscale silhouette with
  a soft glow (`.battle-hero-silhouette`) instead of the full-color emoji
  facing the player - "the character is staring back at the player" with
  no back-of-head emoji available to draw instead. Real custom back-view
  art per hero option is tabled for later.
- Resting at the well (only when it actually heals - already-full-HP
  stays a no-op) now plays a collapsing blue ring + landing glow on the
  player's own map tile (`playWellHealEffect`), instead of silently
  setting HP to max.

### Fixed
- Multi-mob parries no longer stack one PARRY! badge/flash per monster
  parried in the same press - `resolveMonsterWindup` gained a
  `playHeroEffect` option so `attemptParry`'s multi-mob loop can suppress
  the per-monster call and fire one shared effect instead.
- Buying a second (or third, fourth...) unequipped gear item in the shop
  no longer silently overwrites the previous item's "equip now?" prompt -
  `pendingEquip` became `pendingEquipQueue`, rendering one prompt row per
  queued item plus a dismiss-all ✕ on the banner. That ✕ was originally
  built reusing `.screen-close-x` (the shop's own top-right "Leave"
  button's style) and rendered nearly on top of it - fixed to a small
  inline button scoped to its own banner instead.

### Changed
- Iron Helm/Armor/Greaves now cost ~4.5x their Cloth equivalent (70g/
  90g/65g, up from 35g/45g/30g) instead of ~2.2x, so a fresh run walks
  through the Cloth tier before Iron is affordable rather than skipping
  it. First-pass numbers, not yet played against a full run.
- A monster species' first eligible group encounter is now pinned to the
  minimum group size (`killCountSizeCap`), climbing by one every 5
  further kills of that species until it catches up to whatever the
  existing NG+/zone1Steps escalation already allows - previously a
  species crossing the group-spawn kill threshold could immediately roll
  anywhere up to an already-escalated max from unrelated grinding.
- Tool-dungeon guardians (Axe/Pick/Boat/Portal) got +50% HP (140→210,
  175→265, 210→315) - two telemetry playthroughs this session both
  showed Axe Guardian dying in 7-9s at 85-100% HP remaining, no tougher
  than an ordinary wilderness fight despite being a guaranteed-tool
  guaranteed-reward encounter. Attack/defense untouched - this only
  extends the fight, it doesn't add real danger. Pending a real tuning
  pass with `scripts/simulate-balance.js`.

## [0.24.6] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- Local-testing-only debug characters, reached via a `?debug=<key>` URL
  param (`js/systems/debugCharacters.js`) - raised while verifying the
  0.24.5 popup-collision fix needed a character with every ability
  unlocked and didn't want to keep hand-pasting a console script.
  `?debug=level10` upserts a "[Debug] level10" save (level 10, all 5
  abilities unlocked, Iron gear at the NG+0 upgrade cap, all 3 tools) into
  the normal save-slot list - picked, played, and deleted exactly like
  any real save, and a complete no-op for anyone who hasn't typed the
  param. `saveSlots.js` gained `upsertSlot` (create-or-overwrite at a
  fixed id) to support this, distinct from `createSlot`'s always-fresh
  generated id.

## [0.24.5] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- Floating battle popups (damage numbers, crits, and the Perfect!/Parry!/
  New Max! badges) no longer stack on top of each other. Raised from a
  screen recording: two hits landing close together spawned their "-N"
  numbers at the exact same fixed point, fully overlapping for their
  whole 1.4s lifetime, and a badge could land inside its own number's
  flight path too - `showDamageNumber`/`playPerfectTimingEffect`
  (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) always positioned from the target's
  rect alone, with no idea what else was already on screen for that
  target. Fixed with a shared per-zone allocator, `claimPopupColumn`:
  every popup for a zone - damage number, crit, or badge alike - measures
  its own real rendered width, then claims an exclusive horizontal column
  just past whichever side (left/right of the target) is currently less
  crowded. Because no two live popups ever share a column, a number's
  upward drift can't cross into a badge sitting above it - there's no
  shared x left for it to cross through - and because widths are measured
  rather than guessed, a 4-digit hit or a bigger crit font claims exactly
  the room it needs with no manual retuning as damage numbers grow across
  NG+ cycles. Designed and approved against an interactive mockup
  (`docs/superpowers/scratch/battle-popup-lab.html`, published as an
  Artifact) comparing four placement schemes side by side with a live
  overlap detector; Timothy picked the "side-by-side fan" scheme with a
  20px minimum gap (`POPUP_MIN_GAP_PX`). The old `liveDamageNumbers`/
  `livePerfectBadges` tracking arrays are merged into one `livePopups`
  list, since the allocator needs every kind visible to work at all.

## [0.24.4] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- The version footer ("v`<x.y.z>` · What's New") was invisible on the
  start screen since the 0.24.0 redesign - `.start-scene`'s full-bleed
  `position: fixed` background has no `z-index`-losing static siblings
  to worry about on any other screen, but `#version-footer` (a later,
  unpositioned sibling of `#app`) painted underneath it there. Raised
  because Timothy wants to name save-file characters after the version
  they were created in and needs the number visible up front. Gave
  `#version-footer` `position: relative; z-index: 1` (`css/styles.css`),
  matching `.start-panel`'s own stacking - no JS change, the footer was
  already being rendered correctly, just hidden.

## [0.24.3] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- The 0.24.2 wrangler pin (`wranglerVersion: '4.127.1'`) broke the live
  deploy: that wrangler release requires Node >=22, but
  `actions/setup-node@v7` was still pinned to Node 20, so the deploy
  step failed outright (see the 0.24.2 entry below - the unpinned
  behavior never hit this because it silently fell back to an older,
  Node-20-compatible wrangler@4.x). Bumped `node-version: 20` → `22` in
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` alongside the pin. Confirmed live via
  `gh run watch` on the push that introduced this fix.

## [0.24.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Smith upgrade level is capped again, but the cap now rises with NG+
  cycle instead of staying fixed forever. The 2026-09-01 uncap
  (`MAX_UPGRADE_LEVEL` no longer enforced) let a single NG+ cycle climb
  as far as gold allowed - a fresh NG+0 save reached `ironSword +8`,
  surprising enough that Timothy asked for the old ceiling back. New
  `getMaxUpgradeLevel(ngPlusCycle)` in `js/systems/inventory.js` returns
  `MAX_UPGRADE_LEVEL + UPGRADE_CAP_STEP_PER_CYCLE * ngPlusCycle` (3 at
  NG+0, +2 per cycle after that), and `upgradeItem` throws once a slot
  hits it. `smithScreen.js` disables that slot's Upgrade button and
  labels it "Maxed for NG+`<cycle>`" instead of showing a cost. Applies
  prospectively only - a save already above the new cap for its cycle
  keeps its current level, it just can't go higher until the cap rises
  on the next NG+ transition.

### Fixed
- Deploy workflow pins `wranglerVersion: '4.127.1'` on the
  `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v4` step (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
  Without it, every deploy first tried `npx wrangler@latest --version`,
  which fails on current npm (missing `--yes`) and fell back to an
  explicit `npm i wrangler@4` install - harmless but wasted overhead on
  every single run.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Basic Attack's swing effect is now a quick CSS-drawn slash mark on the
  target instead of a large weapon emoji flying in from the hero's own
  portrait and spinning a full 360° over 1.5s
  (`playAttackSlash`/`.battle-attack-slash` in `js/screens/battleScreen.js`/
  `css/styles.css`). Fixes two related reports: the animation reading as
  "silly spinning," and that same sprite's start position briefly covering
  the "You" label every time, since it always began centered exactly on
  the hero's own zone before traveling. Ability swings (Impale/Sever/
  Lacerate/Faultline/Super Scream) are unchanged - only plain Attack's
  swing was replaced. The now-dead `swingEmoji` weapon-emoji-override
  field (`js/data/items.js`) is removed along with it.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- Start screen redesign: the background scene now fills the entire
  browser window edge-to-edge (`.start-scene` goes `position: fixed`
  rather than being boxed inside the card's own rounded corners), the
  card and its text are noticeably larger throughout, and the old inline
  hero-emoji/skin-tone `<select>` pair on the new-game row is replaced
  with a three-step flow: name entry, then a large-tile hero picker
  (`js/screens/startScreen.js`) with big emoji tiles (no text labels),
  live skin-tone swatches, a Shuffle button that re-rolls every tile's
  displayed skin tone (never the plain, un-toned base glyph), and a 🎲
  Random Character button that fills in a random hero, tone, and
  generated name (`js/data/randomNames.js`, drawn from words already
  used elsewhere in the game - monster/item/ability names). First DOM
  test coverage this screen has ever had
  (`tests/startScreenDom.test.js`).

## [0.23.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Landing a hit no longer guarantees knocking the target's ATB gauge back
  - it's now a 5% chance per hit (`ATB_KNOCKBACK_CHANCE`, `rollKnockback`
    in `js/systems/combat.js`), on the player-hits-monster direction only
    (`resolvePlayerAttack`, `resolveAbilityUse`). With abilities now
    cooling down in seconds rather than under a second (see 0.23.1), the
    old guaranteed-every-hit knockback was keeping monsters' own attack
    timers from ever filling, not just preventing spam. The
    monster-hits-player direction (`resolveMonsterAttack`'s `playerAtb`)
    is untouched - confirmed dead code today, since the player's own ATB
    gauge was removed from the UI in the ability-GCD rework and nothing
    reads that field anymore.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Parry window widened back from 10% to 20% of the windup bar
  (`PARRY_ZONE_START_PERCENT` 90 → 80 in `js/systems/parry.js`, matching
  `.battle-parry-zone` in `css/styles.css`). It was narrowed 2026-09-01
  over concern that a skilled player could win almost anything with
  well-timed parries, but the shared 10s parry cooldown shipped
  2026-09-02 already closes that gap on its own, so the extra-narrow
  window was no longer needed. A progressive shrinking-window idea was
  also considered and explicitly shelved in favor of this simpler flat
  revert - see the "Progressive shrinking parry window" entry in
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`.
- Abilities 1-4 (Impale/Sever/Lacerate/Faultline) now each carry their own
  cooldown layered on top of the shared GCD (`overrideCooldownMs` in
  `js/systems/abilities.js`: Impale 3s, Sever 4s, Lacerate 4.5s, Faultline
  5s), graduated by unlock level. Before this, all four shared only the
  ~1s GCD with nothing else distinguishing them, so spamming just Impale
  the instant it unlocked at level 2 was exactly as fast as rotating
  through every ability - confirmed with the balance simulator: a
  level-2 character in a starter sword + cloth tunic won 100% of fights
  (100% HP left) against every near-town monster and several NG+2-scaled
  ones. Impale's own damage multiplier also dropped 0.8 → 0.55 to keep
  it from being a strictly-better spammable option even at its new,
  shorter cooldown. These specific numbers came from comparing this
  graduated approach against a flat 5s cooldown on all four, which fixed
  the early stomp equally well but crushed L4/L5 win rates against
  Dragon tier 0 and Jurassic Jerky much harder for no early-game benefit.
- The ability/attack/parry cooldown "clock wipe" buttons now animate
  smoothly instead of visibly jumping in 300ms steps
  (`animateCooldownWipes()` in `js/screens/battleScreen.js`, a
  `requestAnimationFrame` loop independent of the 300ms game tick that
  patches each wipe element's `--pct` directly by id).

### Fixed
- The battle dialog no longer grows/shrinks mid-fight when the widen or
  potion-buff indicator text appears (`.battle-widen-indicator`,
  `.battle-potion-buff-indicator` in `css/styles.css` now reserve
  `min-height: 1.1em` like their sibling indicators already did) -
  same "dialog size doesn't jump around" fix already applied to
  dead-monster slots on 2026-08-31, extended to these two.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- Abilities 1-4 (Impale/Sever/Lacerate/Faultline) no longer wait on the
  player's ATB "swing timer" gauge - replaced with a shared, speed-scaled
  global cooldown (GCD) that reuses each ability's existing per-ability
  cooldown field/UI instead of a new timer. New `abilityGcdMsForSpeed`
  (`js/systems/combat.js`: `ABILITY_GCD_BASE_MS = 1150`,
  `ABILITY_GCD_MS_PER_SPEED = 30`, `ABILITY_GCD_FLOOR_MS = 500` - exactly
  1000ms at the player's starting speed of 5) and `applyAbilityGcd`
  (`js/systems/abilities.js`) propagate one ability's use to every
  unlocked non-buff ability's cooldown at once, so it's a true shared
  lockout, not 4 independent per-ability cooldowns. `canUseAbility` drops
  its now-unused `ready`/`alwaysReady` params. The player's ATB gauge
  (`playerCombatant.atb`, its UI bar, `updateAtbBars()`'s hero half) is
  removed entirely from `js/screens/battleScreen.js` - monsters keep
  their own, untouched. Attack's spam-decay system, monster ATB/windup,
  Super Scream (exempt from GCD propagation via its `buff` type),
  Lacerate's retrigger sweet-spot, and Parry are all explicitly
  unaffected - Lacerate's retrigger window can now outlive its own
  (much shorter) cooldown, and a re-press during that overlap
  intentionally still triggers the retrigger buff rather than a fresh
  cast, pinned by a new test. `scripts/simulate-balance.js` and
  `scripts/simulateAbilityPolicy.js` mirror-updated so balance reports
  reflect the new mechanic.
- Flee is now unconditionally available (no readiness gate at all) - it
  was previously gated on the same ATB gauge despite its own tooltip
  already claiming to "retreat... instantly."

### Note
- The balance simulator's before/after comparison (see
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-ability-gcd-rework-notes/`) shows a
  large win-rate increase from L4 onward, including several previously-
  unwinnable matchups (Super Mean Meatloaf, Ghost Apple Supreme, Jurassic
  Jerky, and the Dragon tiers at various levels) becoming guaranteed
  wins. Monster stat retuning was deliberately NOT done in this version -
  it's a separate follow-up decision pending manual playtesting feedback.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- In-battle mechanic explainer system: a dismiss-required popup fires the
  moment a new ability unlocks (post-battle, alongside the existing
  ability-unlocked celebration banner in `js/main.js`) and again the first
  time the attack-streak-decay mechanic actually lands a decayed hit
  (mid-battle, pausing combat via the existing `pauseBattle()`/
  `resumeBattle()` path in `js/screens/battleScreen.js`). New
  `js/screens/mechanicExplainerScreen.js` renders both, sharing a
  `renderSectionsHtml()` helper since `battleScreen.js` can't route the
  mid-battle one through `screenManager.js`'s `mountOverlay()` - it's
  itself already mounted as the active overlay at that point. New pure
  helpers: `attackFalloffJustTriggered` (`js/systems/combat.js`, seen-gated
  via `state.seenScreens`, same mechanism as the map screens' own
  first-visit banners) and `buildAbilityExplainerSections`
  (`js/systems/abilities.js`). Explainer copy lives in new
  `js/data/abilityExplainers.js`, currently empty placeholders - Timothy
  writes the actual text, not this session - so the whole feature is gated
  off by default behind a new `mechanicExplainersBeta` Settings > Feature
  Flags toggle until it's filled in.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- The town exit routing arithmetic (landing 1 tile out from the town
  entrance per direction) is pulled out of `js/main.js`'s untested
  `handleTileAction` into a new pure `resolveTownExitLanding(action,
  townEntrance)` in `js/systems/world.js`, with direct unit tests
  covering all 4 directions plus non-matching actions
  (`tests/world.test.js`). Closes a real coverage gap flagged during
  0.21.0's final review: `main.js` itself is never imported by any test
  in this codebase, so this routing had no automated coverage at all
  before this change - only a manual code-trace. No behavior change.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Shop, blacksmith, quest board, and well now show an always-on wooden
  signpost label above their tile (`SIGN_LABEL_BY_TILE` lookup and the
  signpost render step in `js/screens/mapScreen.js`, `.map-tile-signpost`
  in `css/styles.css`) instead of requiring proximity to identify them.

### Changed
- Town's single `🚪` door exit is replaced with 4 directional tree-gap
  exits, one centered on each of town's 4 border walls
  (`TILES.treeGapNorth/South/East/West` in `js/tiles.js`, wired into
  `townMap.js`'s legend). Each is an unmarked walkable gap in the tree
  wall (no icon), and `js/main.js`'s `handleTileAction` routes each
  one's `exitTownNorth/South/East/West` action to `enterMap('center', ...)`
  landing the player 1 tile out from town in the matching direction, via
  a new `TOWN_ENTRANCE` constant anchoring all 4 to the wilderness
  `center` map's `@` point.
- Town's tile grid (`js/maps/townMap.js`) grew from 16x12 to 20x14 to
  make room for the 4 new wall-gaps plus breathing room around the
  existing shop/smith/quest-board/well and the player's starting
  position.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-03-town-exits-and-signage-design.md`
for the full design and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-town-exits-
and-signage.md` for the implementation.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- `js/data/soundManifest.js`'s sound/music path helpers and the theme map
  now derive from `DEFAULT_THEME` instead of hardcoding `'realistic'` -
  previously cosmetic only, but would have silently broken if the default
  theme ever changed.
- The Lacerate retrigger's auto-close check in `battleScreen.js`'s `tick()`
  now runs after that tick's own render instead of before it, so the
  boundary tick that first crosses the window's `windowMs` still renders
  once with the window state that produced it, instead of the flag
  flipping before that render ever happens.

### Added
- Lacerate's self-retrigger window button now flashes distinctly
  (`.battle-ability-button-retrigger-sweetspot`, reusing the parry zone's
  `battle-zone-pulse`) once real elapsed time lands inside its 80-100%
  sweet-spot sub-range, on top of the steady glow shown for the rest of
  the window - the flash the original ability-rotation-v2 design doc
  wanted but never got built (see BACKLOG.md).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Audio engine: Web Audio API-based sound/music playback with a
  theme-aware sound manifest (`js/data/soundManifest.js`,
  `js/systems/audio.js`). Sounds and music load on demand and are
  cached after first play, so no theme costs bandwidth until it's
  actually used, and a theme missing a sound falls back to the
  default `realistic` theme's file.
- Settings screen: per-category volume sliders and mute toggles for
  Combat/UI/World/Music, plus a sound theme selector — gated behind a
  new "🚧 Feature Flags" section's `audioBeta` checkbox (off by
  default) since no real audio assets exist yet. `initAudio()` never
  runs at all for a player with the flag off, so the whole audio
  system stays completely inert until it's turned on.
- The 7 existing visual-effect functions (crit/normal hits, ability
  swings, revive, level-up, generic and tool-pickup celebrations,
  item pickup toast) now trigger their matching sound, once real
  audio files are dropped into `assets/audio/realistic/` and the
  `audioBeta` flag is enabled.

### Fixed
- Cross-task integration bugs caught by this feature's final
  whole-branch review (never shipped live, fixed before this version's
  first push):
  - `initAudio()` no longer throws and blanks the whole game on startup
    when Web Audio is unavailable (Firefox with webaudio disabled, Tor
    Browser, some webviews) — it now catches construction failure and
    runs silent instead.
  - `setTheme()` is now idempotent (no-ops when the theme hasn't
    actually changed), so every settings-screen interaction no longer
    wipes and refetches the current theme's whole buffer cache.
  - A basic Attack no longer plays its hit sound twice (doubled
    amplitude/phasing) — `swingSoundIdFor`'s fallback no longer reuses
    `hitNormal`; only named abilities get their own distinct swing
    sound, layered on top of the hit sound as intended.
  - Volume sliders in Settings now commit on release (`onchange`)
    instead of firing a `persist()` + full audio resync on every drag
    tick.
  - Concurrent first-plays of the same sound (e.g. an AOE ability
    hitting several monsters at once) now share one in-flight fetch/
    decode instead of each issuing its own.
  - Added a settings.js↔audio.js integration test and broadened the
    settings-screen DOM tests to round-trip all 4 audio categories,
    not just 2.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- Rewrote the 4 damage abilities' rotation (`js/systems/abilities.js`,
  `js/screens/battleScreen.js`) around distinct roles instead of a flat
  power ramp, and renamed three of them: Stab → **Impale** (strong
  single-target hit), Chop → **Sever** (hits its target plus one random
  other living enemy, still fine 1-on-1), Slash → **Lacerate** (keeps its
  delayed bleed tick, and re-pressing it right after landing buffs the
  rest of your abilities for a while), Sweep → **Faultline** (icon
  🌪️ → 🪨; keeps its weak all-enemies hit and defense-shred, and now
  also widens what Impale/Sever/Lacerate can hit for 6s after use).
  Every ability now resolves instantly - the live wind-up timing meter
  and the old Stab→Chop/Slash→Sweep combo-priming system are both gone
  entirely, replaced by each ability's own mechanic above. Super Scream
  is unchanged. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-ability-rotation-
  v2-design.md` for the full design and
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-02-ability-rotation-v2.md` for the
  implementation.
- `scripts/simulate-balance.js`/`scripts/simulateAbilityPolicy.js`
  updated to match: no more combo-primer priority in the simulated
  player's action policy, Lacerate's retrigger buff modeled with the
  same stand-in timing-skill rate the old combo system used.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- New shared `js/screens/dialogChrome.js` helper (`bindEscapeClose`,
  `bindBackdropClose`) gives every closeable screen the same close
  affordances: Escape, a corner ✕ button, and (for backdrop-dimmed
  overlays) clicking outside the dialog panel. Closes the open "UI
  consistency: universal Escape-to-close + aligned dialog chrome"
  backlog item (raised 2026-09-01), extended per Timothy's ask
  (2026-09-02) to also cover click-outside.
- Wired into the 8 backdrop overlays (Settings, Inventory, Message Log,
  Loot Reference, Changelog, Stats Panel, Logout Confirm, Boss Prompt)
  and the 3 full-page screens (Shop, Smith, Quest Board — Escape only,
  no backdrop to click outside of). Logout Confirm and Boss Prompt map
  Escape/✕/click-outside to their cancel path (`onCancel`/
  `onWalkAway`), never the destructive confirm action; Boss Prompt's
  NG+ confirm sub-step backs out one level at a time rather than
  exiting the whole prompt. Battle screen and the forced Post-Death
  Travel prompt are deliberately untouched — the former isn't a
  dismissable dialog, the latter has no cancel action to fall back to.

### Changed
- Quest Board gained the same corner ✕ button Shop/Smith already had
  (`.screen-close-x`), alongside its existing "Leave" button.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- Parry (`js/systems/parry.js`, `js/screens/battleScreen.js`) now shares
  a 10-second cooldown (`PARRY_COOLDOWN_MS`) across every parry input -
  the `s`/`S` key, the Parry button, and the per-monster ATB-bar/parry-
  hint click shortcuts. Pressing it starts the cooldown immediately
  whether or not it actually catches a monster, which is the entire
  anti-spam mechanism (no separate penalty needed). This also closes the
  separate "parry can win almost anything" balance concern, since a
  skilled player can no longer chain unlimited parries in a solo fight
  either.
- In fights with 2+ monsters, landing a parry while off cooldown now
  catches *every* monster currently mid-wind-up, regardless of how far
  into its wind-up it is - not just those inside the narrow 90-100%
  zone. Solo fights are unchanged otherwise: still requires hitting that
  same zone. This replaces the old always-available global sweep (which
  required the same narrow zone per monster, making multi-mob parry play
  out as repeated solo parries with more visual noise) with a genuine
  multi-mob-specific mechanic. The per-monster ATB-bar/parry-hint click
  shortcuts now share the same cooldown as the keyboard/button path -
  see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-multimob-parry-cooldown-
  design.md`.
- `scripts/simulate-balance.js`'s solo parry modeling updated to match:
  an attempt is only possible off cooldown, and a miss costs the
  cooldown the same as a hit, replacing the old flat per-attack
  probability that had no cooldown concept at all. Existing dragon/
  NG+2-tier matchup numbers were tuned against that old assumption and
  haven't been re-validated against this one yet - flagged for a real
  playtest pass, not re-tuned blind here.

## [0.17.4] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- `tests/battleScreenDom.test.js`'s three real-time parry-timing tests
  (windup-animation persistence, click-vs-keydown parry parity, and the
  PARRY! badge test) were flaking in CI (not locally) since `d67cf27`
  narrowed the parry sweet spot from an 80-100%-of-windup zone (200ms) to
  90-100% (100ms) without updating these tests' hardcoded real-time waits,
  which had been tuned to land mid-zone under the old, wider window and
  were now sitting right on the new zone's lower edge with zero margin -
  any scheduling jitter on the GitHub Actions runner could push the press
  past the window's close. Replaced the fixed waits with a poll for the
  windup animation's actual real start time, then a wait computed to the
  live zone's real midpoint (derived from `PARRY_ZONE_START/END_PERCENT`
  and `PARRY_WINDUP_DURATION_MS`), so a future window resize can't
  silently reintroduce the same gap. 0.17.2 and 0.17.3 both had this
  block their Cloudflare Pages deploy (`npm run test` gates the deploy
  step) - this is what actually gets them live.

## [0.17.3] - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- Near-town/far-corner monster attack (boar, bat, snake, goblin, frog,
  direWolf, spider, scorpion in `js/data/monsters.js`) raised from their
  original ~9-14 to 13-19. `calculateDamage` (`js/systems/combat.js`)
  floors at 1 once a monster's attack falls at or below player defense
  (`max(1, attack - defense)`), and player defense (+1/level flat, plus
  cheap early gear) was crossing these monsters' original attack values
  by ~L4-5 - the same floor bug dungeon-tier (orc/wraith/skeleton)
  already got a fix for, never extended to this roster. Sized to clear
  the floor through most of leveling while staying safe at L1 (a larger
  bump matched to survive through full-iron gear was tried and reverted
  - it nearly one-shot a fresh L1 character; see the `js/data/
  monsters.js` comment and `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s "player
  outpaces near-town/far-corner content" thread for the full
  investigation, including why a further fix via monster HP/speed turned
  out to be a structural dead end, not just unfinished tuning).

## [0.17.2] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- `js/systems/telemetry.js`'s localStorage mirror is no longer write-only:
  `startSession` now reads back whatever the previous page-load's session
  persisted before resetting the buffer, so closing a tab (or a crash)
  before that session ever flushed no longer loses its events outright -
  they resurface in the next session's buffer (for Copy Play Log) and its
  pending flush queue (for the next auto-flush to a running dev server).
  Already-successfully-flushed events aren't resurrected into the pending
  queue, so recovery can't cause duplicate lines in a local
  `analytics/events.jsonl`. The storage format changed from a plain array
  to `{ buffer, pending }` to track this; the old plain-array format is
  still read on a first load after upgrading, so no existing mirror is
  discarded.
- Potion drops (`drop.potionId` from `rollDrop`) now log an `item_drop`
  telemetry event, matching the existing gear-drop logging in
  `logDropEvent` (`js/main.js`) - previously only `drop.item` was logged,
  silently missing every potion a monster dropped.
- Reforging Superior gear to Mythic (`js/screens/smithScreen.js`'s
  `tryReforge`) now logs a new `item_reforged` telemetry event - the one
  smith-screen action that had no telemetry coverage at all.
- Added the `ngPlusCycle` envelope field (present on most other gameplay
  events) to `upgrade_purchased`, `gear_equipped` (both the Inventory and
  Shop equip-prompt call sites), `potion_used` (both in- and out-of-battle
  call sites), and `ability_used` - these five were the only logged event
  types missing it, which made cross-referencing them against NG+ cycle
  harder than every other event type.

### Fixed
- Final whole-branch review fixes for the playthrough telemetry plan
  (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-01-playthrough-telemetry.md`): a
  malformed percent-escape in a request URL (e.g. `/%`) no longer
  crashes `tools/dev-server.mjs` - `resolveStaticFilePath` now catches
  the `decodeURIComponent` throw and treats it as a 404 instead of
  taking down the whole dev server process. The shop's post-purchase
  "Equip this?" prompt (`js/screens/shopScreen.js`) now logs
  `gear_equipped` the same way `js/screens/inventoryScreen.js`'s equip
  button already does - it was the one `equipItem()` call site Task 5
  missed. `js/main.js`'s `logInventorySnapshot` no longer throws if
  `state.inventory` contains a stale item id no longer present in
  `ITEMS` (e.g. from an old save after an item was renamed/removed) -
  that used to abort the rest of `handleBattleEnd`'s level-up block,
  including the real `persist()`/`renderHud()` calls right after it.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Playthrough telemetry logging (`js/systems/telemetry.js`): the game now
  records level-ups, tool pickups, battle outcomes, ability/potion use,
  gear-equip choices, item drops, smith upgrades, and NG+ transitions to
  an in-memory/localStorage-backed session buffer. `tools/dev-server.mjs`
  (a new zero-dependency Node static server, replacing `python3 -m
  http.server` for local dev - see README) accepts `POST /__telemetry`
  and appends events as newline-delimited JSON to a gitignored
  `analytics/events.jsonl`. The Settings screen's new "Copy Play Log"
  button copies the current session's buffered events (via the
  Clipboard API, falling back to a selectable textarea) regardless of
  whether the dev server is running - the only delivery path on the
  live site, which has no backend. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-01-playthrough-telemetry-design.md`.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- Removed the hard ceilings on NG+ cycles (`MAX_NG_PLUS_CYCLE`, was 2) and
  smith upgrade levels (`MAX_UPGRADE_LEVEL`, was 3) - both `canStartNgPlus`
  and `upgradeItem` no longer reject past those numbers. Monster
  hp/attack/defense scaling (`getNgPlusCombatOverrides`), reward scaling
  (`getNgPlusRewardMultiplier`), and upgrade cost/stat-bonus formulas
  (`upgradeCost`, `getItemEffectiveStats`) were already unbounded formulas
  with no cap logic of their own, so no other code needed to change to make
  both axes climb indefinitely. `MAX_UPGRADE_LEVEL` stays defined as a plain
  constant - `scripts/simulate-balance.js` still uses it as the fixed level
  its "maxed ceiling" test builds are measured at, it's just no longer read
  as an in-game limit. First half of the NG+-loot-ceiling backlog item
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-01-balance-tuning-roadmap-handoff.md`,
  Session 2) - deliberately the smallest fix that removes the wall, before
  spending effort on making drops themselves more interesting again.

### Fixed
- `js/screens/smithScreen.js` no longer stops offering the upgrade button at
  level 3 (the removed "(MAX)" display branch) - upgrading kept working past
  the old cap once `upgradeItem` stopped rejecting it, but the UI hadn't
  caught up.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- Halved the parry timing window (last 10% of the wind-up bar instead of
  the last 20%) - landing one reliably was letting a skilled player win
  fights that should stay hard, since a parry fully negates the incoming
  hit, reflects half its damage back, and resets the attacker's timer.

### Fixed
- `scripts/simulate-balance.js` now models a chance to actually land a
  parry (`--parry-rate`, default 0.3) instead of assuming every player
  takes every hit - every balance number the simulator has ever produced
  was quietly biased conservative on this. No gameplay change, but future
  balance decisions from this tool will account for it.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- The post-battle/event flavor banner (e.g. battle outcome summaries,
  well/treasure/gate messages) no longer overlaps the header - it used
  to sit at a hardcoded `top: 12px` regardless of the header's real
  height. Moved to a side panel under the header (JS measures `#hud`'s
  actual bottom edge on every show, so it stays clear even if the
  header's height changes later), with a close (✕) button, and hovering
  it now pauses the auto-hide countdown - it only starts counting down
  again once the mouse leaves.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- A Settings screen (new HUD button) with one adjustable option so far:
  how long the battle item quick-select menu waits before auto-closing.
  Saved per save-slot, not as a single global browser setting.
- The Circle of Ultimate Portaling is now fully playable: press `P`
  while exploring to drop a portal at your feet, walk into it to warp
  to a fixed spot in town, walk into the paired portal there to warp
  back to exactly where you left. The pair vanishes once you've made
  the full round trip. Guarded by a new `portalGuardian` fight in its
  own dungeon, matching the existing axe/pick/boat tool pattern
  exactly (terrain painter updated to support a 4th tool dungeon too)
  - Timothy still needs to hand-place the guardian's dungeon entrance
  with the terrain painter before it's reachable.
- The town well's free healing is now blocked while a portal round
  trip is pending (outbound leg used, return leg not yet taken) - stops
  the portal from turning the well into a free heal reachable from
  anywhere. Dropping a new portal always clears this, at the cost of
  losing the old portal's return trip.

### Changed
- The battle item quick-select menu no longer closes after each potion
  picked - raised live during testing, so a run of loadout keys (e.g. `i`
  then `2`, `3`, `4`) drinks each one in a row instead of needing the menu
  reopened between picks. Instead it auto-closes on its own a short beat
  (1s by default, adjustable in Settings) after your last pick, with a
  countdown bar - Escape still closes it immediately.
- Internal: default branch renamed `master` → `main` (local rename +
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s trigger updated to match; the actual
  push/GitHub default-branch switch is a separate, deliberately
  unpushed step).

### Fixed
- Power Ring now equips into a ring slot instead of the accessory slot
  (it was misclassified as `slot: 'accessory'` in the item data) - a
  migration relocates any already-equipped copy on existing saves.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- 10 new buff potions, purchasable in the shop: 8 timed stat/effect buffs
  (attack, defense, speed, lifesteal, extra swing chance, elemental proc,
  thorns, crit chance - each a 12s boost) and 2 one-shots (guaranteed
  crit on your next hit, and a Second Wind that saves you from one
  lethal hit per battle).
- A 4-slot potion loadout, set up from the Inventory screen's Potions
  tab - pick which potions to carry into battle. Defaults to the heal
  potion in slot 1, so existing muscle memory keeps working with zero
  setup.
- A new in-battle item quick-select menu (press `i`, pick 1-4/arrows/
  click) that drinks from your loadout - battle slows to 25% speed
  while it's open instead of fully pausing, so there's still some
  urgency.
- Monster kills now have an 8% independent chance to also drop a random
  buff potion, on top of the existing gold/item roll.

### Changed
- Internal: `pauseBattle()`/`resumeBattle()` now take an optional
  `timeScale` (default 0, today's exact hard-stop behavior) used by the
  item quick-select menu's slow-mo above.

### Fixed
- Inventory screen's potion "Use" button no longer renders for non-heal
  consumables, which would have corrupted player HP to NaN.
- A slow-mo pause (the item quick-select menu) left its interval running
  forever if the menu was closed by drinking/cancelling rather than the
  P-key pause - a real background CPU leak on every potion drunk
  mid-battle, not just a test artifact (found via a hanging test suite).

## [0.14.3] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- Bumped the three GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to
  their latest major versions - `actions/checkout` v4→v7,
  `actions/setup-node` v4→v7, `cloudflare/wrangler-action` v3→v4 -
  clearing the "forced to run on Node.js 24" deprecation warning GitHub
  had started attaching to every deploy run (those actions still
  targeted Node 20 internally). Checked each project's own
  changelog/release notes first: `actions/checkout` v5-v7 are
  Node-24-runtime bumps with no input changes; `actions/setup-node`
  v5/v6's breaking changes (auto package-manager cache detection,
  auto-caching limited to npm) don't affect this workflow, which already
  passes `cache: npm` explicitly and has no `packageManager` field in
  `package.json`; `wrangler-action` v4's only breaking change is
  defaulting the installed Wrangler CLI to v4 instead of v3 - accepted
  as-is (not pinned back to v3) since `wrangler pages deploy`'s basic
  command syntax is unchanged, and verified by watching the next real
  deploy run through to a successful, live result. This repo's own
  `node-version: 20` input (the Node version used to run `npm ci`/`npm
  run test`, unrelated to the actions' own runtime) is untouched.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- A third CI check in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: for any push that
  changes non-doc files, `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` must be
  empty (i.e. actually bumped into a dated section), not just present -
  closes the last gap in this repo's versioning checklist enforcement.
  The existing "CHANGELOG.md was touched" check only required *some*
  entry to exist somewhere in the file; it didn't catch a push landing
  with real content still sitting under `Unreleased` instead of bumped,
  which is exactly the drift class from the `0.7.2` postmortem (the
  in-game footer reads `PLAYER_CHANGELOG[0]` directly, so an un-bumped
  `Unreleased` block means the footer silently falls behind). Raised
  2026-09-01 while confirming the `0.14.1` deploy landed correctly.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Rung-3 gear cleanup (three of the five known follow-ups from the
  2026-08-28 item-quality-tiers review, per Timothy's own scoping - the
  other two, AOE lifesteal/proc stacking per target and the ±1 rounding
  drift on displayed deltas, are deliberate/accepted and left alone):
  - `describeItem` (`js/systems/inventory.js`) now takes `state` and
    factors in the item's own smith-upgrade level via
    `getItemEffectiveStats`, not just its tier - a Superior sword
    upgraded to +2 previously showed the same tooltip stat as a fresh,
    unupgraded one.
  - Added a shared `STAT_LABELS` map + `formatStatDelta` (also in
    `inventory.js`), replacing the two duplicated `formatDelta`
    functions in `inventoryScreen.js`/`shopScreen.js` that printed raw
    camelCase stat keys (`lifestealPercent +15`) whenever an effect stat
    was nonzero. Also applied inside `describeItem`'s own stat listing,
    which had the same underlying bug for any unique-effect item's
    tooltip (Vampiric Fang, Ember Ring, etc.) - not the specific site
    the backlog named, but the same fix.
  - Consolidated the three separate `getEquipmentBonuses(state)` calls
    on `battleScreen.js`'s mount path into one, computed in `mount()`
    and passed into `buildPlayerCombatant`/`buildMonsterCombatant` -
    pure refactor, no behavior change.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Progression feedback for battle damage: a per-move lifetime-best tracker
  (`state.bestDamage`, keyed by ability id / `'attack'`) pops a distinct
  purple "NEW MAX!" badge (`playNewMaxEffect` in `js/screens/battleScreen.js`,
  reusing the existing `playPerfectTimingEffect` pop-badge mechanics) whenever
  a hit beats its move's own recorded best - persists across battles/saves/NG+
  via the existing `persist()` call at battle end, migrated onto old saves by
  `migrateBestDamage` (`js/state.js`). Also added a live DPS meter in the
  battle sidebar (`#battle-dps`), computed from cumulative player damage over
  `battleElapsedMs` (advanced only inside `tick()`, so pausing the battle
  freezes it for free - no separate pause bookkeeping needed) and reset each
  battle. Raised 2026-08-31 (see `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`).

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Every battle action button now has a real plain-language "what this
  does" description in its hover tooltip, not just name/cooldown/combo/
  damage numbers - matching what Parry's tooltip already had. Attack
  explains its spam-decay mechanic, Item states the exact heal amount
  (`ITEMS.potion.heal`), Flee explains it always works except against
  bosses, and each of Stab/Chop/Slash/Sweep/Super Scream now has a
  `description` field in `js/systems/abilities.js` describing its actual
  effect - Super Scream's damage-boost percentage and duration are
  computed from `ROTATION_BONUS_MULTIPLIER`/`buffDurationMs` at render
  time rather than hardcoded, so they can't drift from the real values.
  Motivated by mid-battle pause (0.13.0): pausing to go read a tooltip
  is only useful if the tooltip actually explains something.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Mid-battle pause: a pause button docked upper-left of the battle
  dialog (separate from the ability action bar) plus a `P`/`p` keybind,
  both toggling pause/resume. Freezes everything that decides the
  outcome - the 300ms tick (ATB fill, cooldowns, buff duration), a
  monster's windup/parry-zone CSS animation and its real-time parry
  window (shifted forward on resume by however long the pause lasted,
  via `shiftWindupStart()` in `js/systems/parry.js`, so the paused time
  never counts as elapsed windup time), and the ability timing-meter's
  `requestAnimationFrame` loop and sweet-spot pulse. All player battle
  actions (attack, ability, parry, item, flee, target-select) are
  no-ops while paused. A dim overlay + "PAUSED" label spans the whole
  dialog-and-action-bar card (not just the hero/monster area, so the
  ability buttons read as grayed out too), using `pointer-events: none`
  so hovering for a native `title` tooltip - the actual point of
  pausing, per the idea that spawned this - still works right through
  it. Already-committed cosmetic effects (damage numbers, crit shake,
  lunges, death animation, an in-flight ability's AOE stagger) are
  deliberately left running rather than frozen - they don't resolve
  into anything a pause could get wrong, and freezing them had no
  gameplay payoff. See `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s "mid-battle
  pause" entry (now moved to BACKLOG_SHIPPED.md) for the raised idea
  and open questions this closed out.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- Mythic-tier gear now hits noticeably harder: `QUALITY_TIER_MULTIPLIERS.mythic`
  raised from 1.35 to 1.5. A fully maxed Mythic item now tops out at 2.625x
  its base stats (was 2.3625x). Aimed at NG+2 specifically feeling like a
  real payoff for maxing gear out, not just barely survivable.
- `scripts/simulate-balance.js` now models the Rung-3 gear on-hit effects
  (crit% bonus, extra-swing chance, lifesteal, elemental proc, thorns
  reflect) that only ever lived in `battleScreen.js`'s
  `playerEffectBonuses`/`applyOnHitEffects` before — the simulator's
  `makeBuild()` now carries those stats through and `simulateBattle()`
  applies them the same way the real battle screen does. Added a second
  "maxed Mythic L12 (NG+2, +rings)" build alongside the existing
  ringless one so the two ring slots (Ember Ring, Windfury Ring) —
  previously silently absent from the maxed-Mythic ceiling measurement —
  are actually represented. This also surfaced and fixed a second,
  unrelated gap: the simulator never applied `resolveMonsterAttack`'s
  returned `monsterHp` at all, so a thorns reflect was computed but
  silently discarded even before this session. No parry modeling added —
  the simulator still assumes a player who never successfully parries a
  single hit (a known, pre-existing, documented scope limit), which is a
  conservative bias on measured player power, not an optimistic one — see
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s Multi-zone progression section for the
  fuller story and what's still open (getting to genuinely one-to-three-
  hit kills by end of NG+2 needs a different lever than this multiplier,
  and the parry-rate gap is its own follow-up).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- The floating damage number and the PERFECT!/PARRY! badge now get their CSS
  animation duration from the same `DAMAGE_NUMBER_DURATION_MS`/
  `PERFECT_TIMING_BADGE_MS` constants that drive their removal `setTimeout`,
  set inline instead of a second hardcoded value in `css/styles.css` —
  the same "two numbers that only happen to agree" hazard the death
  animation's `--battle-death-anim-ms` fix (0.12.0, below) closed for that
  animation, applied here to the other two spots in `battleScreen.js` with
  the identical shape.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Battle action row redesigned to icon-only buttons (icon + a small keybind
  chip in the corner, no more wrapping text), and given a Parry button
  (🛡️ S) so the mechanic has a visible reminder and a click target instead
  of being keyboard-only. A red conic-gradient "clock wipe" now shows
  cooldown remaining instead of a countdown number; the ability name,
  cooldown, combo status, and damage estimate that used to sit in the
  button's own text now live in its hover tooltip.
- The action row now docks as its own stationary bar directly under the
  battle dialog instead of living inside it, so it no longer swirls in/out
  with the dialog's own mount/unmount animation.
- That action bar now splits into two rows: the numbered ability keys
  (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) on top, Parry/Attack/Item/Flee below - matching the
  muscle memory of resting fingers on the number row first.
- Both action rows now center their buttons under the dialog instead of
  packing them against the left edge.
- Fixed the dialog rendering narrower than (and misaligned under) the
  action bar - the dialog and action bar are now both fixed-width panels
  inside one shared container, guaranteed to line up exactly.
- The dialog and action bar now swirl in/out together as one unit on
  battle start/end, instead of only the dialog animating while the empty
  action bar sat on screen a beat longer.
- Action buttons now stay visible (though inert) through the post-battle
  pause and fade away together with the dialog, instead of disappearing
  the instant the battle ends.
- The dialog's exit animation now waits for the battle-ending hit's own
  effects (damage number, death animation, revive glow) to finish first,
  instead of starting while they're still playing.
- A dead monster's slot now keeps its space reserved in the dialog
  instead of collapsing, so the dialog no longer resizes/re-centers each
  time a monster dies mid-fight, or visibly shrinks right before its exit
  animation plays on the final kill.
- The monster death animation's visible duration is now driven directly
  from the same timing value that decides when the slot gets hidden,
  instead of two separately-hardcoded numbers that happened to agree -
  retuning one now automatically keeps the other in sync.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- Ring-slot items (`slot: 'ring'`) were compared/counted against a
  nonexistent `state.equipment['ring']` key in two places: the Smith and
  inventory item-stat-delta comparison (`getItemStatDelta` in
  `js/systems/inventory.js`) and the Loot Reference "own N" count
  (`js/screens/lootReferenceScreen.js`), which never recognized an
  equipped ring as owned. Both now resolve through the real `ring1`/`ring2`
  keys.
- A save from before Ember Ring was reclassified from `slot: 'accessory'`
  to `slot: 'ring'` could have it stuck equipped in the accessory slot
  forever. `migrateRingSlots` (`js/state.js`) now relocates a
  legacy-equipped Ember Ring into `ring1` on load.
- The Smith screen showed a permanently-empty, permanently-disabled
  upgrade select/button on an equipped ring, since no upgrade material
  exists for ring slots. It's now suppressed for any slot with no
  upgrade material defined at all, while the normal 5 gear slots still
  correctly show a disabled-but-real button when the player just doesn't
  currently hold a material. Empty ring rows also now read "Ring 1:" /
  "Ring 2:" instead of the raw `ring1`/`ring2` key.
- The Stats panel's effects list didn't include Retribution Charm's
  thorns bonus, so it was invisible even when equipped.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Mythic gear tier (NG+ only): a fourth quality tier above Superior, obtainable via drop luck or a gold + Mythic Essence smith reforge.
- Two new NG+-exclusive unique items: Retribution Charm (reflects damage) and Windfury Ring.
- Two new ring equipment slots (Ring 1 / Ring 2), alongside the existing weapon/head/body/legs/accessory slots. Ring-slot items (Ember Ring, Windfury Ring) only drop from sufficiently tough monsters.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Animation Lab (`tools/animation-lab/`): a dev-only visual tool for
  designing weapon-swing animations, following the same never-deployed,
  no-build-step pattern as `tools/terrain-painter/`.

### Changed
- Weapon-swing keyframes (Attack/Stab/Chop/Slash/Sweep) are now
  data-driven inside `js/screens/battleScreen.js`, so Animation Lab can
  regenerate them - no visible gameplay change from this alone.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Monster groups can now reach up to 6 members (up from 3) and mix
  species within one group instead of always-identical copies
  (`js/systems/groupEncounters.js`).
- Two independent pressures push group size toward that cap: NG+ cycle,
  and time spent wandering zone-1 wilderness screens this cycle
  (`state.zone1Steps`, `js/screens/mapScreen.js`). NG+ also raises how
  often a group spawns at all, not just how big it is.

### Fixed
- `#overlay` (the battle dialog's own backdrop) had no `overflow-y`, so a
  6-member group's monster row wrapping onto two lines on a short
  viewport could clip the battle menu with no way to scroll to it.
  Added `overflow-y: auto` as a safety net (`css/styles.css`).

## [0.8.6] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- Weapon swings (Attack/Stab/Chop/Slash/Sweep) all traveled the full
  distance from hero to target, which read as a projectile flying at the
  enemy rather than the hero's own weapon swinging near them. Attack and
  Chop specifically now stay anchored close to the hero (dx/dy only lightly
  bias the direction) instead of traveling to the target - the target's
  existing hit-flash/shake/damage-number still sells the impact. The hero's
  own emoji also now lunges toward the target on every swing (the same
  lunge-and-snap-back trick monsters already use for their own attacks),
  so the character itself visibly moves into the strike.

### Changed
- Plain Attack's swing (whatever weapon's equipped) redesigned - was
  holding one fixed diagonal orientation with no rotation, which read as
  inert. Now arcs up and over the target along a curved "rainbow" path
  while spinning a full rotation, and carries on through past the target
  rather than retracting - a big tumbling swing, distinct from Stab/Chop's
  precise stop-short thrust.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- Stab and Chop now stop short of the target's own center (70% of the way
  in) instead of traveling all the way to it - with no way to hide the
  blade tip inside the target sprite, going all the way to center read as
  stabbing/chopping all the way through and out the other side. Slash and
  Sweep are unchanged - a full pass-through already reads correctly for a
  wipe/sweep motion.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- Stab's swing was facing back toward the hero instead of the enemy -
  flipped 180 degrees.
- Chop's swing redesigned so the axe blade (on the left side of the 🪓
  glyph, not the right) actually leads into the target: it now approaches
  from the target's own right and swings down-left into it, instead of
  falling straight down from directly overhead.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- Attack's weapon-swing sprite (0.8.0) used a weapon's own inventory emoji
  verbatim, which looks fine in a gear list but not for three weapons whose
  icon is a body-part pun rather than a weapon shape - Dragon Fang Blade
  (🦷), Fossil Fang (🦖), and Vampiric Fang (🦴) all swung that literal
  tooth/dinosaur/bone. Added an optional `swingEmoji` override
  (`js/data/items.js`) so these three swing a proper blade (🗡️) instead;
  every other weapon is unaffected.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- 0.7.9's `#overlay` z-index bump (raised to sit above `#item-pickup-toast`)
  had an unnoticed side effect: every fixed-position battle effect appended
  directly to `<body>` - damage numbers, the "PERFECT!" timing badge, the
  monster's own ranged-attack projectile, and (as of 0.8.0) the new
  weapon-swing sprites and their afterimage trail - was still sitting at a
  lower z-index than the dialog itself, so all of them had been silently
  rendering *behind* the battle screen instead of over it. Raised each of
  their z-index values above `#overlay`'s (`css/styles.css`) so they're
  actually visible again.

### Changed
- Weapon-swing sprites (0.8.0) are noticeably bigger and slower than
  originally shipped - confirmed via live testing that this reads much
  better than the original subtle version.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Player attacks now play a weapon-swing animation instead of resolving as a
  silent number - Attack swings the equipped weapon's own emoji, while
  Stab/Chop/Slash each swing their own ability icon with a distinct motion
  (thrust/overhead chop/diagonal wipe) (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`).
- Sweep now plays as one large traveling swing sprite that visits every
  living target in turn, staggered so each monster's hit lands as the sprite
  actually reaches it, rather than every target taking damage in the same
  instant with no visual to match.
- A crit hit's swing (and Sweep's swing, always) now trails a fading
  afterimage of ghost copies along the same path.
- A crit killing blow has a chance to play an alternate "split in two" death
  animation instead of the usual spin-and-shrink.

### Changed
- Sweep's cooldown/attack-streak/combo bookkeeping now commits at the moment
  the ability is pressed rather than after its (now staggered) hits finish
  resolving, matching this file's existing press-time-semantics convention
  for every other ability.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- Shop could never sell a single Fine/Superior copy of a gear item - only
  the Plain stack had a sell button. Each owned tier now gets its own sell
  row in the shop (`js/screens/shopScreen.js`), priced the same as Plain
  (no tier premium, matching the existing Sell Duplicate Gear precedent).

### Changed
- Removed the crit/parry battle-dialog shake (`.battle-dialog-shake-crit`)
  - too much motion mid-fight. The character-level sway reaction is
    unchanged. A landed parry now gets its own distinct gold "PARRY!"
    badge plus a brief flash on the hero's own emoji
    (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`'s `playParryEffect`), replacing the
    reused ability-timing-hit "PERFECT!" badge as the "that worked" signal
    now that the shake is gone.
- Status log battle-outcome entries now also record the equipped gear (all
  5 slots) at the moment combat ended, alongside the effective stats
  already snapshotted there - useful for diagnosing whether combat balance
  is behaving as designed without a separate lookup.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- NG+ never reset the player's tools (axe/mining pick/boat) or
  `clearedGates`, so a player who'd already earned every tool and cleared
  every tool gate could walk straight to the dungeon entrance on a fresh
  NG+ cycle, skipping zone 1's tool-gated obstacles entirely.
  `resetWorldForNgPlus` (`js/systems/ngPlus.js`) now strips tool items from
  inventory and resets `clearedGates` on every future NG+ transition,
  reproducing the exact same reachability graph a brand-new save starts
  with - re-fighting each tool guardian already worked with zero extra
  code (the guardian tile has no "already defeated" flag). A one-time
  `migrateNgPlusToolCarryover` migration also retroactively strips
  carried-over tools from any save already sitting at `ngPlusCycle >= 1`
  from before this fix (inventory only, not a retroactive `clearedGates`
  revert - re-gating already-cleared terrain out from under a save
  mid-playthrough would be a bigger surprise than this migration is
  meant to cause).

## [0.7.7] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- Town's own tile grid grown from 8x6 to 16x12 - it was never actually
  resized before, but the viewport around it grew a lot in 0.7.1 (fills
  the real browser window instead of a fixed 1020x700px cap), so the same
  small town started reading as a tiny cluster in a much bigger empty
  viewport. `startPosition` moved to match the regrown layout.
- Shop buy buttons: gear rows (weapons/armor/accessories) now offer a
  single "Buy" button instead of the full 1x/5x/10x/100x set - equipping
  only ever uses one copy at a time, so bulk-buying gear was never
  actually useful. The Potion row (the only `type: 'consumable'` in the
  shop) keeps the full bulk-quantity set.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- "Sell Duplicate Gear" (added in 0.7.4) moved from the Inventory screen to
  the Shop screen - Timothy's own correction: selling belongs in the shop,
  not something available anywhere/anytime. Same behavior otherwise (sells
  every unequipped duplicate copy of a gear item, keeping one, at half
  price), scanning the player's whole inventory rather than just
  `SHOP_CATALOG`.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- Spamming basic Attack decays its own damage down to a 0% floor (once
  all 5 abilities are unlocked), but Ember Ring's `elementalProcDamage`
  is a flat stat unrelated to the hit's own damage number, so it kept
  dealing its full fixed proc damage even on a fully-decayed 0-damage
  spammed swing - defeating the point of the spam throttle.
  `applyOnHitEffects` (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) now scales the
  elemental proc's damage by the same streak multiplier as the attack
  itself; ability hits (never spam-decayed) are unaffected.
  `lifestealPercent` needed no equivalent fix - it's already a
  percentage of the real, already-decayed hit damage.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Inventory's Gear tab now has a "🧹 Sell Duplicate Gear" button - sells
  every unequipped duplicate copy of the same gear item (keeping one),
  same half-price sale as the shop. Gear-only: materials/potions are meant
  to stack past 1, and equipping an item already removes its own inventory
  copy (`equipItem`), so a gear entry's quantity can only be >1 from owning
  multiple unequipped copies in the first place. New
  `sellDuplicateGear` in `js/systems/inventory.js`.

### Fixed
- The post-fight "what you got" item-pickup toast (anchored near the HUD
  Inventory button) could render on top of the inventory screen if opened
  while the toast's 1.2s fade was still playing - `#item-pickup-toast` had
  an explicit `z-index: 30` but `#overlay` (every overlay screen: inventory,
  shop, smith, etc.) had none, so the toast painted above it. `#overlay`
  now sets `z-index: 35`.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- Random wilderness/dungeon encounters had no memory of the last one, so
  two fights on consecutive steps was always possible - rare per single
  pair of steps (e.g. 15% * 15% = 2.25%), but noticeable over a real play
  session and felt bad whenever it landed. `mapScreen.js`'s `tryMove` now
  tracks a new `state.encounterCooldown` counter: any random encounter
  (including the rare elite roll) sets it to `ENCOUNTER_COOLDOWN_STEPS`
  (2), and it ticks down once per real step regardless of tile type,
  suppressing the encounter roll entirely until it reaches 0 - guaranteeing
  at least 2 encounter-free steps after every fight. Doesn't apply to
  tile-triggered fights (guardians, the boss), which aren't random rolls.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- Dragon Fang Blade (attack 14→16), Fossil Fang (attack 12→14), and Dragon
  Scale Mail (defense 10→12, maxHp 15→18) all buffed - these named boss/elite
  drops are excluded from the Fine/Superior quality-tier system entirely, so
  a stat bump was the only way to make them feel a bit stronger.

### Fixed
- Smith-upgrade level was keyed by bare itemId, so every tier of the same
  base item (Plain/Fine/Superior) shared one upgrade level - equipping a
  freshly found Fine Iron Helm could show it already maxed just because the
  Plain copy had been upgraded. Now keyed by itemId+tier, so each tier
  upgrades independently. Existing saves migrate automatically on load: a
  legacy level moves to whichever tier is currently equipped in that slot,
  or Plain if nothing matching is equipped.
- The inventory list could show the identical stat delta for a Plain and a
  Fine copy of the same item (e.g. both reading "attack -16") even though
  the Fine copy is genuinely stronger - `getItemStatDelta` rounded the
  final subtracted difference instead of rounding each side first, so two
  raw deltas less than 1 apart could land in the same rounding bucket.
- The Shop/Smith screen's close-x button could overlap a long title (e.g.
  "Smith (Gold: 6401)") - the title now reserves room for it.
- rpg.burghertime.com could keep serving a stale cached copy of `js/`/`css/`
  files for hours after a deploy, even though the origin was already serving
  the current files (confirmed via direct curl diff) - `_headers` now sets
  `Cache-Control: no-cache` on both, so browsers always revalidate with the
  server (a cheap 304 if unchanged) instead of trusting a long local cache.
- CI now fails a deploy if non-doc files changed in a push but
  `CHANGELOG.md` wasn't touched in that same push, so a code change can't
  ship without at least an `## [Unreleased]` entry.
- The in-game footer/"What's New" screen (`js/data/playerChangelog.js`,
  read by `PLAYER_CHANGELOG[0]` in `js/main.js`) was stuck showing `v0.7.0`
  even after `0.7.1` shipped - the dev-facing `CHANGELOG.md` got its version
  bump, but the separate player-facing changelog never got a matching entry,
  so there was no way to tell which version was actually live. Backfilled
  the missing `0.7.1` entry and added `tests/versionSync.test.js`, which
  fails `npm run test` (and therefore CI) whenever `CHANGELOG.md`'s newest
  dated version and `PLAYER_CHANGELOG[0].version` drift apart, so a future
  version bump can't ship without updating both together.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Inventory screen now has switchable tabs (Gear/Materials/Potions/Tools)
  instead of one long scrolling list, plus a per-tab sort control
  (Alphabetical/Quantity, with Rarity added on the Gear tab). Equipment
  stays always-visible above the tabs since it's a fixed 5-slot status view,
  not a growing list. Defaults to the Gear tab, alphabetically sorted.

### Fixed
- The map viewport was capped at a fixed 1020x700px regardless of the actual
  browser window size, wasting most of a large desktop window. `#app` now
  fills the real remaining space below the HUD/above the footer (a flex
  column on `body`), and `.map-viewport` fills all of `#app` — so
  `computeViewportTileCount` (`js/screens/mapScreen.js`), which already
  measured the viewport's real rendered size, now shows meaningfully more of
  the world on a large window instead of stopping at 21x13 tiles.
- `#hud` is now `position: sticky; top: 0`, so it stays visible instead of
  scrolling out of view.
- The random mini-dungeon map marker no longer reuses the mining pick's own
  `⛏️` emoji (confusable with actually receiving a pick) — swapped to `🥾`.
- The tool-pickup celebration's orbiting emoji now anchors to the player's
  actual on-map tile instead of always popping up at viewport-center
  (mirrors `mapScreen.js`'s existing `playMonsterFleeEffect` pattern), and
  the orbit animation is twice as slow as before for more effect.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Continuous camera-following viewport replaces discrete per-screen map
  rendering: the wilderness's 25 linked screens (and town/dungeon interiors,
  through the same mechanism) now stitch into one global tile-coordinate
  space (`js/systems/worldGrid.js`) that the camera pans across, rather than
  swapping to a fresh full-screen render at each screen boundary.
  `js/screens/mapScreen.js`'s `render()`/`tryMove()` were rewired onto this
  grid (`screenToGlobal`/`globalToScreen`) in place of the old teleport-based
  edge-transition path.

### Fixed
- Crossing a screen boundary directly onto a tool-gated tile (mountain/
  thicket) with the right tool now correctly converts it to a stump/rubble
  marker — previously this conversion only fired when the gate was cleared
  mid-screen, not when the very first tile stepped onto after a screen
  transition was itself the gated tile, since the old teleport path
  (`handleEdgeTransition`) never ran the gate-clearing check at all.
- A tile's worn-path trail no longer leaks per-screen local coordinates
  across a screen boundary: `edgeOwner`, the trail gradient id, and the
  neighbor-wear lookup in `js/screens/mapScreen.js` now resolve against
  GLOBAL coordinates instead of the current screen's local ones, so two
  screens' tiles visible in the same viewport can no longer disagree on a
  shared edge (a visible seam/kink) or collide on gradient ids.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- Resizing the browser window (grow then shrink) left the map area stuck
  at its old, larger size until a full page reload — Safari-only; Chrome
  and Firefox never had this bug. Root cause: Safari doesn't reliably
  re-run CSS Grid's track-sizing algorithm when a grid whose tracks size
  `aspect-ratio` children (`.map-grid`'s `repeat(N, 1fr)` tracks /
  `.map-tile`'s `aspect-ratio: 1`, `css/styles.css`) has its own container
  shrink on a live resize — confirmed via Timothy's own Safari screenshots
  (grid stayed large after a grow-then-shrink resize; reproduced the same
  scenario in Chrome with no issue). Fixed with a `resize` listener
  (`js/screens/mapScreen.js`) that forces a synchronous reflow of
  `.map-grid` (toggling `display: none` → `''` before the next paint, so
  nothing visibly flashes), which makes Safari redo the track-sizing pass
  against the grid's corrected size. Closes the backlog's "Responsive
  layout: browser window resize gets stuck" entry.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- In-game version number and changelog: a footer at the bottom of the page
  shows the current version and opens a new "What's New" overlay
  (`js/screens/changelogScreen.js`) listing player-facing highlights per
  version. Deliberately backed by a new hand-curated data file
  (`js/data/playerChangelog.js`), not a runtime fetch/parse of this file —
  Timothy's call: this file's own entries are written in developer prose
  (file/function names, internal mechanics) and aren't fit to show
  players directly, so the in-game view stays a separate, manually
  maintained translation instead. Closes the backlog's "Version display in
  the UI" entry. Everything below this line that had been sitting under
  `Unreleased` is folded into this same `0.6.0` release, cut now as part of
  shipping this feature (a MINOR bump — it bundles several completed
  systems, per this file's own versioning rule above).
- Battle screen transitions and a perfect-timing payoff, closing out the
  "spike up animations" initiative: the battle dialog now swirls in on
  mount (`battle-screen-swirl-in`, `js/screens/battleScreen.js`/
  `css/styles.css`) and swirls out just before the post-battle pause ends
  (`battle-screen-swirl-out`, timed via `EXIT_ANIM_MS` inside `endBattle()`
  so it finishes right as `unmountOverlay()` clears the DOM, not before). A
  landed ability timing-hit or successful parry now shows a distinct
  "PERFECT!" badge (`playPerfectTimingEffect`) instead of just the ordinary
  hit-flash and log suffix; a successful parry also now gets the same
  crit-shake treatment a rolled crit does (`playHitEffect(..., true)` in
  `resolveMonsterWindup`'s parried branch) — a judgment call, not something
  explicitly asked for, on the reasoning that "perfect timing" is exactly
  what landing a parry is.
- A first-time tool pickup (axe/mining pick/canoe) gets a richer
  celebration sequence instead of the plain burst+text pop other
  celebrations use: the tool emoji pops up and loops most of a circle
  (`playToolCelebration`, `celebration-burst-tool-play` in
  `js/screens/celebrationEffect.js`/`css/styles.css`), then a bordered
  speech-bubble callout (`#celebration-tool-callout`) states the
  capability just unlocked (e.g. "Clears mountain gates blocking the
  way!"), timed to land as the orbit finishes. No sprite/pose system
  exists for a literal "hold it overhead" — this is a stylized
  substitute, called out as a design judgment rather than assumed
  silently.
- A level-up that crosses one or more ability-unlock thresholds now
  announces the newly-unlocked ability/abilities (e.g. "New ability
  unlocked: 🗡️ Stab!") right after the existing level-up celebration
  (`js/main.js`). Staggered 1600ms after the level-up banner rather than
  fired in the same tick, since `playCelebration` isn't queued — it just
  overwrites the shared banner/burst elements immediately, so an
  unstaggered second call would clobber the level-up message before it
  was ever seen. Multiple abilities crossed in one battle (a big single
  XP grant can jump several levels via `applyXp`'s loop) combine into one
  message rather than firing once each. Verified in-browser via a
  temporary debug hook driving real `handleBattleEnd` calls: a level 1→2
  jump announced Stab alone, a forced 3→9 jump announced Chop/Slash/Sweep
  together, both correctly sequenced after "Level up!" rather than
  replacing it.
- Terrain painter (`tools/terrain-painter/`): hovering the canvas now
  shows a translucent outline over exactly the cells the current brush
  would paint (`drawBrushPreview`/`brushCells` in `painter.js`), and
  `[`/`]` bump brush size up/down (clamped to the existing 1-15 slider
  range, kept in sync with it). Both close out the "Terrain painter:
  small UX polish items" backlog entry alongside the scroll fix below.
- Wilderness grid grew from 3x3 (9 screens) to 5x5 (25 screens): 16 new
  outer-ring screens (`js/maps/wilderness/*.js`, e.g. `farNorthwest`,
  `northNortheast`, `farSouth`) wired into the existing generic
  `neighbors: { north, south, east, west }` topology, with symmetric
  links verified by `tests/maps.test.js`. The dragon's dungeon entrance
  eligibility moved from the old 3x3 grid's 4 corner screens
  (`northeast`/`northwest`/`southeast`/`southwest`) to the new 5x5 grid's
  4 far-corner screens (`farNortheast`/`farNorthwest`/`farSoutheast`/
  `farSouthwest`, `CORNER_SCREEN_IDS` in `js/systems/dungeonEntrance.js`)
  so it stays at the true edge of the expanded world. All 16 new screens
  use the existing far-corner monster tier (`direWolf`/`spider`/
  `scorpion`, 0.15 encounter chance) — no new spatial difficulty
  gradient yet, that's still open per the backlog. The 16 new screens
  ship today with placeholder terrain only (plain grass, sealed on their
  outer world-edge sides with tree tiles) — the organic terrain (varied
  mountains/lakes/woods, cross-screen-continuous per Timothy's ask) is
  still-pending manual work, not part of what shipped here. A new
  browser-based dev tool, `tools/terrain-painter/` (`index.html` +
  `painter.js`), was added to support that follow-up work: it loads all
  25 screens onto one continuous canvas laid out exactly like the real
  5x5 world so painted terrain reads as connected across screen
  boundaries, and exports one screen's `LEGEND`/`ROWS` at a time to the
  clipboard for pasting back over that screen's file. See
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s "Zone 1 map expansion + organic
  terrain" entry for what's left.
- A real worn-path trail effect, replacing the old flat "visited tile"
  tint (`js/systems/trail.js`, `js/screens/mapScreen.js`,
  `js/systems/exploration.js`; design doc/plan under
  `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`,
  `2026-08-25-worn-path-trail`). `state.visited`'s per-tile entry is now
  `{ count, dirs }` instead of a boolean - `count` is the walk count
  (drives wear), `dirs` is the exact set of edges (n/s/e/w) the player
  has actually crossed at that tile. Walking over ground leaves a wavy
  dirt-trail stroke reaching toward only those directions - not inferred
  from whether a neighbor happens to also be visited, which produced a
  "ladder" of false connections between separately-walked parallel
  corridors - or a small centered dot when nothing's been crossed yet.
  Each stroke's color gradients from this tile's own wear toward the
  connected neighbor's, and its width is the average of both tiles' wear
  (symmetric, so the two tiles sharing an edge always agree), so wear
  differences between adjacent tiles taper instead of meeting at a hard
  seam. Wear (up to a 10-visit cap) is baked entirely into color - a
  bare-unworn stroke blends into the tile's own ground color, a fully
  worn one is the solid trail color - deliberately not opacity, which
  couldn't stay consistent across a tile border; trail color itself is
  keyed by the underlying terrain (grass, cave floor, water). A tile with
  2+ connected directions (a fork/junction) now paints a solid hub circle
  at its own center, on top of every stroke, sized to the widest connected
  stroke there (`trailHubRadius` in `js/systems/trail.js`) - each
  direction is stroked independently at its own width (SVG can't taper a
  stroke's width along its length), so a fork whose branches carry
  different wear used to show a hard rectangular notch right where a
  thinner stroke met a wider one; the hub covers it so narrower strokes
  now visually emerge from inside it instead. A stroke's color at the tile
  *border* it's reaching toward is now the midpoint between this tile's
  own wear and the neighbor's (`trailBorderFraction`), not the neighbor's
  raw wear - each tile used to taper all the way to the *other* tile's own
  color right at the shared edge, so two different colors landed on the
  same physical point (each side insisting the border already was the far
  side) and produced a hard color wall, confirmed live on a real save,
  even though each side's gradient used matching hex values *somewhere*,
  just at opposite ends. This was the real cause behind several rounds of
  "there's a seam" reports across the session; the hub-notch fix above
  was real too but smaller in effect.
  Exiting town lands the player orthogonally adjacent to the town gate
  instead of diagonal to it, so a first step toward town connects to it
  in one move; the landing tile itself still starts as an isolated dot
  until that first real step, same as any other fresh tile.
- The town quest board tile (📋) now glows (`map-tile-quest-ready`,
  a looping gold `box-shadow` pulse) whenever at least one quest is
  turn-in ready, so it's noticeable from a distance on the town map
  instead of only discoverable by walking up and checking. New
  `hasAnyQuestReady(state)` helper in `js/systems/quests.js` reuses
  `canTurnInQuest` across every `QUEST_REQUIREMENTS` entry; wired into
  `js/screens/mapScreen.js`'s per-tile render.
- Worn-path trails (`state.visited`) now carry over across NG+ cycles
  instead of resetting to blank like every other world-progress field
  (`js/systems/ngPlus.js`'s `resetWorldForNgPlus`) - Timothy wants the
  trails he's walked kept between playthroughs. Purely cosmetic data
  (per-tile walk history for trail rendering), nothing else reads it as
  a per-cycle completion signal, so nothing else changes.
- A new rung-3 unique-item effect: crit chance. `rollCrit` now accepts an
  optional bonus fraction on top of the base 10% `CRIT_CHANCE`, threaded
  through `resolvePlayerAttack`/`resolveAbilityUse`/`resolvePotionUse`
  (`js/systems/combat.js`/`abilities.js`) from a new `critChancePercent`
  equipment stat (`js/systems/inventory.js`'s `STAT_KEYS`). New drop:
  Keen Eye (👁️, accessory, `critChancePercent: 8`), added to
  `UNIQUE_EFFECT_ITEM_IDS` (`js/systems/loot.js`) alongside Vampiric
  Fang/Swift Strike Charm/Ember Ring — same rare monster-kill-drop pool,
  same "found only, never sold" rule. Deliberately scoped to the player's
  own crit rolls only, not `resolveMonsterAttack` — a monster's crit
  chance is its own, unaffected by the player's gear. Not modeled in
  `scripts/simulate-balance.js`, matching the same scope gap already
  accepted for lifesteal/extra-swing/elemental-proc.
- Parry's red zone and the ability timing meter's green sweet spot now
  flash (`battle-zone-pulse`, a `filter: brightness()` pulse) the exact
  real-time instant their moving fill crosses into the actionable zone,
  instead of only ever showing a static color change. Timed via
  `animation-delay` set at windup/meter start (delay = zone-start-percent
  × duration) rather than polled each tick/frame, so it can't lag behind
  like a polled trigger would — same real-time-not-polled approach as the
  parry fill fix below. `js/screens/battleScreen.js`/`css/styles.css`.

### Fixed
- Parry's visible red zone could lag noticeably behind the real accept
  window ("I feel like I hit before the red section and it parries").
  The keypress check itself already used real elapsed wall-clock time
  (fixed 2026-08-25), but the *visible* fill was still painted from a
  300ms-tick JS snapshot smoothed by a `transition: width 0.3s linear`,
  so what was drawn could trail the real value by up to ~600ms. The
  windup fill now animates via a CSS `@keyframes` animation
  (`battle-windup-fill`, duration = `PARRY_WINDUP_DURATION_MS`) started
  at the same instant the windup begins, painted continuously by the
  browser instead of polled — matching what `resolveParryAttempt`
  actually checks at keypress. `js/screens/battleScreen.js`/
  `css/styles.css`.
- Terrain painter: trackpad two-finger scroll (a `wheel` event on desktop
  Chrome/Firefox, not a touch event, so `touch-action` alone didn't stop
  it) scrolled the page mid-paint-stroke, shifting the canvas under the
  cursor — "it keeps moving around driving me nuts." A non-passive
  `wheel` listener on the canvas now calls `preventDefault()` only while
  a stroke is actively in progress, so scrolling between strokes still
  works normally. `touch-action: none` also added to the canvas
  defensively for real touchscreen input.
- Three map-rendering layering bugs, raised by Timothy 2026-08-25 (see
  `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s "Character/tree layering + a real
  worn-path trail effect" entry) and one more he spotted mid-session:
  - The hero could disappear entirely behind a grass decoration
    (clover/flower): `render()`'s branch order in `js/screens/
    mapScreen.js` checked `isDecoratedGrass` before `isPlayer`, so a
    decorated tile the player stood on rendered only the decoration.
    Restructured so the decoration (when present) and the hero/landmark
    marker both render into the same cell, decoration appended first so
    it still peeks out from behind the hero instead of being suppressed.
  - The character always rendered in front of a tall tree's canopy
    overlapping up from the row below, making it look like standing
    inside the tree rather than behind it. Replaced the fixed `.map-tile-
    player { z-index: 10 }` override with per-row depth sorting: each
    `.map-tile` cell's `z-index` is now set to its own row index in
    `render()`, so a cell's content always paints above the row directly
    north of it, matching normal top-down 2.5D depth rules for any
    overlapping content, not just the hero.
  - Town's action tiles - shop, smith, quest board, well, and the exit
    door - rendered as tiny plain text (the bare `.map-tile`'s 1.2rem
    font-size) instead of as full-square landmarks like the wilderness's
    town/dungeon entrances. They were simply missing from `mapScreen.js`'s
    `FULL_SQUARE_MARKERS` set; added.
- Two more map-rendering bugs, raised by Timothy 2026-08-26:
  - Town/wilderness/dungeon landmark tiles (shop, smith, quest board,
    well, exit, town/dungeon entrances) rendered with a dark box around
    them instead of the surrounding grass showing through. Each one is
    its own distinct tile type in a map's `ROWS` grid (not an overlay on
    a separate grass tile), so it never matched `tile === TILES.grass`
    in `render()`'s className logic and fell through to `.map-tile`'s
    bare default background. Added `GRASS_CONTEXT_MARKERS`
    (`js/screens/mapScreen.js`) - the subset of landmark tiles that
    always sit on a grass floor (every map that places them has
    `'.': 'grass'` in its own `LEGEND`) - and give those the same
    `.map-tile-grass` class obstacles already get. Deliberately excludes
    `miniDungeonEntrance`/`miniDungeonTreasure`, which only ever appear
    inside a mini-dungeon's cave-floor interior.
  - A tall obstacle's canopy overlaps upward into the row above it by
    design (see the character/tree layering fix above), but the map's
    own top row and outer columns have no neighboring row/column to
    absorb that overlap into, so it bled straight past the game's own
    border into the HUD/page behind it. `.map-grid` now clips
    (`overflow: hidden`), cutting that bleed at the map's own edge
    without touching any interior overlap.
- Parries against ranged monsters (goblin/spider/dragon/wraith/skeleton/
  Jurassic Jerky) could silently fail even on a well-timed press: the
  earlier themed-attack-animation pass added a 350ms delay after the
  parry wind-up bar completes, before a ranged hit actually landed
  (`RANGED_PROJECTILE_MS`, so the hit-flash would land when the
  projectile visually arrived). But the wind-up bar (and the
  `monster.windup.active` flag a parry press checks) resets to inactive
  the instant it completes, before that delay even starts - so a parry
  press during the delay window (which visually still looks like the
  attack is resolving, since the projectile is still flying) matched no
  active wind-up and was silently ignored, letting the hit land
  unblocked. `monsterAttack` (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) now resolves
  impact immediately for every attack style, matching how melee always
  worked; the projectile is purely cosmetic and no longer gates the
  mechanical outcome. Found from Timothy's own report ("even when I
  parry sometimes enemies still hit me") rather than a test - this file
  has no unit-test coverage for DOM/timing sequencing (no jsdom in this
  repo), so this class of bug is only ever caught live; see the backlog's
  new Infrastructure entry on that trade-off.

### Changed
- Locked combat abilities are no longer shown disabled — they're hidden
  entirely until unlocked (`abilityButtonsHtml()` in
  `js/screens/battleScreen.js` now maps over `getUnlockedAbilities(state.
  player.level)` instead of the full `ABILITIES` array). The digit-key
  shortcuts (`1`-`4`, `handleKeydown`, same file) now index into that same
  filtered list instead of the full array, so a key's number always
  matches the button showing that number — a fresh level-1 character now
  sees only Attack/Item/Flee, same as Timothy asked.
- Leveling slowed down 4x: `xpForLevel`'s base coefficient (`js/systems/
  leveling.js`) goes 12→48 (the 2026-08-22 balance pass had already taken
  it 10→12; this is a further 4x on top of that, not from the original
  10). Every level's XP requirement scales linearly with the coefficient,
  so this is a uniform 4x at every level including the level-10+ ramp —
  e.g. cumulative XP to reach level 10 goes from 1741 to 6969.
- Attack's spam-decay is now much steeper and its passive recharge much
  slower, per fresh playtesting ("I still find myself just holding down
  attack... the game feels better when I don't use attack so much"):
  `ATTACK_STREAK_DECAY` 0.15→0.35 (`js/systems/combat.js`) so the floor is
  reached by the 2nd consecutive press instead of the 4th, and a new
  `ATTACK_STREAK_RECOVERY_MS` (8000ms) replaces the old "streak resets the
  instant your swing-timer gauge refills" passive reset with a much slower
  real-time-only idle timer — decoupled from the ATB gauge on purpose,
  since that gauge caps at `ATB_MAX` and abilities read the same value for
  their own readiness, so it couldn't represent "recharge slower" on its
  own. Landing an ability still resets the streak instantly, unchanged.
  Mirrored into `scripts/simulate-balance.js`'s `simulateBattle` (which
  had also been silently missing the `unlockedAbilityCount` argument on
  `attackStreakMultiplier` since that mechanic shipped earlier this
  session — fixed as part of this pass, it wasn't modeling the
  ability-scaled floor at all before now).
  **Known trade-off, deliberately accepted rather than tuned away:**
  `geared L6 (full iron)` vs. Dragon tier 0 dropped from 84% win to 0% win
  in the simulator — the two changes compound (less damage per press *and*
  far fewer presses land at full strength over a sustained fight) enough
  to flip some already-close matchups. Timothy's call: keep both changes
  as shipped and revisit with real playtesting data rather than the bot's
  approximation of ability-rotation play, which may not reflect how a
  human actually carries these fights with the rotation.

### Added
- A rare elite encounter: Jurassic Jerky 🦖 (`js/data/monsters.js`), a 5%
  chance (`js/systems/eliteEncounter.js`'s `rollEliteEncounter`) to replace
  any regular wilderness or dungeon encounter, always solo. Stats are 88%
  of the dragon's own tier-0 (hp 132/attack 30/defense 11/speed 10 vs.
  150/34/12/11) — a real near-dragon gear-check, not literally boss-hard.
  Deliberately not flagged `isBoss`, so it's fleeable for free (`playerFlee`
  only blocks fleeing on that flag). Drops a new unique weapon, Fossil Fang
  🦖 (+12 attack, between Iron Sword's 6 and Dragon Fang's 14). Its appear
  line is adaptive instead of a random pick from a fixed pool: a lighter
  in-game win-chance estimate (`getEliteAppearLine`, reusing the same
  average-damage/hits-to-kill technique `isMonsterOutclassed` already uses,
  not a full battle simulation) buckets into outmatched / close-fight /
  favorable framing. Verified live via a forced encounter: correct name/HP,
  the favorable-tier line ("you've got the edge here") against a
  wildly-outclassing test build, Flee enabled, and Fossil Fang landing in
  inventory on kill.

### Changed
- Weak-mob surrender/flee no longer opens the battle dialog at all. The
  pre-fight `resolveWeakMobEncounter` check (`js/systems/combat.js`) moved
  from inside `battleScreen.js`'s `mount()` to `main.js`'s `handleEncounter`,
  running before the overlay ever mounts — previously the dialog always
  rendered first and then auto-closed ~1.2s later even though the outcome
  was already decided. `handleBattleEnd` was already fully self-contained
  (banner/rewards/persist/HUD) and safe to call directly with an empty
  `killedMonsterIds`, so no reward-logic duplication was needed. A new
  `mapScreen.playMonsterFleeEffect(emoji)` shows the monster's emoji flying
  off the player's tile in a random direction (same Web Animations API
  technique as the ranged-attack projectiles) so the player still sees
  something happen instead of nothing at all — matching Timothy's own
  description of the ask. Removed the now-unreachable in-dialog weak-mob
  branch and its `WEAK_MOB_LOG_MESSAGES`/`playWeakMobFleeEffect`/
  `.battle-flee-shrink` (the in-dialog log line is moot with no dialog to
  show it in; `handleBattleEnd`'s existing flavor banner already covers
  the message). Scope unchanged: only solo, non-boss encounters resolve
  this way; multi-mob groups still open the dialog. Verified live via
  computed-DOM polling across several encounters: normal fights still
  open the dialog as before, and a weak-mob resolve showed the flee emoji
  and the correct banner text with `dialogOpen` false throughout.

### Added
- Three new monsters, one per existing tier: Ribbity Ravioli 🐸 (near-town
  wilderness, joins boar/bat/snake/goblin), Spicy Skewer 🦂 (far-corner
  wilderness, joins direWolf/spider), and Bone-in Biscuit 💀 (dungeon-tier,
  joins orc/wraith — ranged 🦴, plus the dungeon-tier-only flavor-line
  treatment). Stats sized to match their tier's existing roster; each drops
  its own new material (Frog Skin 🟢/body, Scorpion Venom 💉/accessory, Bone
  Fragment 🦴/head — picked to fill out the thinnest-covered smith-upgrade
  slots) and is quest-board eligible at its tier's usual kill count. Wired
  into the wilderness `monsterTable`s and the dungeon's. Verified live: all
  three render correctly on the Quest Board with correct name/emoji/reward.
- Regular monster encounters (wilderness + dungeon-tier orc/wraith; the
  dragon is untouched, it already has its own boss-tier system) now roll
  one of 5 named stat variants per spawn instead of always being numerically
  identical: `Puny`/`Lesser`/(baseline)/`Greater`/`Savage`, a +/-15%
  hp/attack spread (`js/systems/monsterVariants.js`'s `pickMonsterVariant`,
  same scaled-override pattern `bossTiers.js`/`ngPlus.js` already use).
  Rolled independently per monster in a multi-mob group. Still the same
  `monsterId` for quest progress/drop tables/kill counts — only display
  name and hp/attack vary. Wired into `handleEncounter` (`js/main.js`),
  gated on the existing `monsterOverridesList === null` branch so boss
  fights (which always pass explicit tier overrides) are unaffected. Caught
  a real bug while wiring this in: `getNgPlusCombatOverrides` only returns
  combat stats, not `name`, so a variant's name was getting silently
  dropped before NG+ scaling was re-layered on top — fixed by carrying
  `name` through separately after that step. Verified live: a wilderness
  encounter showed "Lesser Mega Muffin" at 93 HP (100 base x 0.925,
  rounded), matching the formula exactly.
- Monster attacks are now themed instead of sharing one generic hit-flash:
  each monster's `attackStyle` (`js/data/monsters.js`) is `melee` (a quick
  lunge toward the hero and back, `.battle-monster-lunge`) or `ranged` (its
  own `projectileEmoji` flies from the monster to the hero via the Web
  Animations API before the hit lands — goblin 🍙, spider 🥟, dragon 🔥,
  wraith 🍎; boar/bat/snake/direWolf/orc stay melee). Ranged attacks delay
  the log/HP-bar/hit-flash/outcome-check by the projectile's flight time
  (`RANGED_PROJECTILE_MS`, `js/screens/battleScreen.js`) so the flash lands
  when the projectile visually arrives, not before; melee stays immediate.
  Caught and fixed a real bug while verifying live: `buildMonsterCombatant`
  whitelists which fields carry over from `MONSTERS[id]` onto the in-battle
  combatant object and was silently dropping `attackStyle`/`projectileEmoji`,
  so every monster fell back to the melee lunge regardless of its actual
  style — fixed by adding both fields to that whitelist.

### Fixed
- The killing-blow hit-flash/shake was silently never playing when it also
  triggered a revive: `.battle-hit-shake`/`.battle-revive-glow` both set
  the `animation` shorthand on the same hero-zone element, and
  `.battle-hit-flash`/`.battle-revive-glow` both set `filter` on the same
  emoji element — in both cases only one declaration can win per property,
  and the later-declared `.battle-revive-glow` always did, so the red
  flash/shake never rendered at all on the exact hit that ends a losing
  fight, jumping straight to the green pulse. Confirmed via live
  computed-style polling before and after. Fixed per the backlog's own
  suggested resolution: `playReviveEffect` (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`)
  now only targets the hero emoji, not the whole zone (so it stops
  contending with the shake's `transform` animation), and
  `battle-revive-pulse`'s keyframes (`css/styles.css`) now animate
  `box-shadow` instead of `filter` (so it stops contending with the
  flash). All three effects now render together on the killing blow.
- Starting NG+ now also resets `lossStreak` to 0 (`resetWorldForNgPlus`,
  `js/systems/ngPlus.js`) — previously a streak carried over from the
  prior cycle, so entering NG+ already deep in a loss streak granted the
  full comeback-potion bonus on the first NG+ death despite nothing
  actually going wrong yet in the new cycle. Timothy's call: NG+ is a
  fresh start, matching how every other world-state field already resets.

- Item pickups now show a small toast (e.g. "🐲 +1 Dragon Scale Mail")
  that pops and floats up near the HUD's Inventory button
  (`js/screens/itemPickupToast.js`), instead of no feedback beyond the
  inventory count silently changing. Positioned from the button's live
  `getBoundingClientRect()` rather than living inside `#hud` itself, so
  `renderHud()`'s frequent full rebuilds don't wipe an in-flight
  animation. A literal cross-screen flight path wasn't feasible — the
  drop resolves after the battle screen has already unmounted, so
  there's no live item-icon starting position to animate from — this is
  the lighter toast/pop alternative instead. New-tool pickups keep their
  existing bigger celebration rather than getting both.
- Basic SEO pass: a real `<meta name="description">`, a more descriptive
  `<title>`, Open Graph + Twitter card tags (with a real screenshot-based
  `assets/og-image.png` instead of a placeholder), a canonical link,
  `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and a `<noscript>` fallback with a
  semantic heading for crawlers/no-JS users. The deploy workflow now
  also stages `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `assets/` alongside the
  existing `index.html`/`css`/`js`.
- Level-up now gets its own dedicated effect beyond the shared star-burst
  celebration: the hero's map tile briefly scales up 2.2x
  (`.map-tile-levelup`), a radiating light-ray burst
  (`repeating-conic-gradient`) fans out from it, and a large embossed
  "LEVEL UP!" text pops in over the screen (`#celebration-big-text`,
  `js/screens/celebrationEffect.js`'s `playCelebration` gained an
  optional `bigText` option). All three fire together from
  `handleBattleEnd`'s existing level-up branch in `js/main.js`.
- Wilderness grass tiles are no longer one repeated green square —
  each tile deterministically picks from `🟩`/`🍀`/`🌼` based on its
  (x, y) position (`pickTileVariant` in `js/systems/world.js`), so the
  same tile always renders the same way but the map reads as varied
  instead of uniform. A first attempt using a plain linear hash
  (`x*31 + y*17`) produced visible diagonal stripes across the grid;
  switched to a proper bit-mixing hash for natural-looking scatter.
- Hero emoji picker grew from 8 to 23 options and gained a real skin-tone
  selector (5 Fitzpatrick tones + Default). Every candidate was verified
  by actually rendering base+modifier combinations rather than assumed
  from the Unicode spec — this caught that the already-shipped fencer
  🤺 and zombie 🧟 don't recolor at all, so the tone dropdown now
  auto-disables (and resets to Default) whenever one of those two is
  selected, instead of silently no-op'ing. ZWJ-sequence options
  (astronaut, artist, pilot) needed the tone modifier inserted right
  after the base person codepoint, not appended at the end, or the
  browser renders it as a stray unstyled color swatch instead of
  recoloring the glyph (`applySkinTone` in `js/state.js`).
- Quest turn-ins now scale instead of staying flat-value forever. Each
  monster tracks its own quest level (`state.questLevel`, starts at 1):
  every turn-in requires one more kill than the last
  (`QUEST_REQUIREMENTS[monster] + (level - 1)`) and grants a growing but
  decelerating reward quantity (`1 + floor(log2(level))` — 1, 2, 2, 3,
  3, 3, 3, 4...), so grinding quest levels gets progressively less
  worth it rather than staying flat-value. Quest board shows the current
  level and actual reward quantity per row. Existing saves default every
  monster to level 1, identical to today's behavior until the first
  turn-in.
- Tool-gated tiles (mountain/thicket) now nudge you the first time you
  walk adjacent to one, before you ever bump into it — "Something here
  looks like it'd need an Axe to get through" if you lack the tool, or
  "You're right next to something you could clear with your Axe" if you
  already have it. Fires once per tile ever (`state.toolGateHintsShown`,
  same one-time pattern as `gateRewards`), not every time you walk past.
- Losing a battle now offers a choice instead of always warping home:
  `Return to Town` (free, same as before) or `Warp to Dungeon Entrance`
  for `10 × player level` gold, disabled if unaffordable. HP restore,
  loss-streak increment, and comeback potions all still happen
  unconditionally first — the choice only changes where you land.
  Warping places you at `state.dungeonEntrancePosition` (the wilderness
  tile leading into the dungeon), not the dungeon interior itself, since
  dungeon-interior progress was never preserved across a loss anyway.
- The dragon rematch prompt now lets you choose which tier to fight
  instead of always auto-escalating to the next one. Every tier from 0
  up through your next uncleared tier gets its own button (e.g. `Tier 0
  (1x HP) ⭐`, `Tier 1 (2x HP) ⭐`, `Tier 2 (4x HP)`), so you can replay
  an already-cleared tier instead of being forced up a difficulty step.
  Replaying a lower tier can't lower your progress (`bossTier` only ever
  moves up on a win) and a loss leaves it untouched, same as before.
- Buying a piece of gear you don't already have equipped now offers an
  inline "Equip now?" prompt in the shop, showing the stat delta versus
  what's currently equipped (same delta logic as the Inventory screen).
  `Equip` swaps it in immediately via the existing `equipItem()`;
  `Not now` (or any other shop action, including selling) dismisses it —
  the item just sits in inventory to equip later, same as today. Doesn't
  reverse the earlier decision to remove auto-equip-on-pickup: this is
  opt-in, one purchase at a time.
- A "🚪 Switch Character" HUD button lets you get back to the title
  screen's save-slot list without closing the tab. Opens a confirmation
  overlay (`js/screens/logoutConfirmScreen.js`, modeled on the boss
  rematch prompt's confirm step) since it's an unexpected action if
  triggered by accident, though not a destructive one — state already
  auto-saves on every map move, so there's nothing to lose. Disabled
  during battle, same as the other HUD buttons.
- Dungeon has its first tool-gated shortcut: an axe-gated thicket tile at
  `(15, 7)` connects the interior maze directly into the boss corridor,
  instead of looping back through the top rows. Clearing any tool gate
  (thicket or mountain) with the required tool now shows a flavor banner
  ("You cut through the thicket with an Axe!"), symmetric with the
  existing locked-gate message. First-ever pickup of a tool item
  (`miningPick`, `axe`) now triggers the celebration effect, telling the
  player what they can do with it.
- Outclassed weak mobs can now give up instead of fighting to the death.
  A non-boss monster killable within 3 average hits has a 35% chance per
  encounter to surrender (full win rewards), flee dropping loot
  (gold/item only), or flee empty-handed (nothing) — each with its own
  battle-log line and a shrink-and-slide-away animation on the monster's
  emoji, resolved instantly in `battleScreen.js`'s `mount()` before the
  normal ATB tick loop starts.
- Combat abilities (Phase 1): five fixed-order abilities unlock as you
  level — Stab (2), Chop (4), Slash (6), Sweep (8), Super Scream (10).
  Each ability has its own real-time cooldown, independent of the ATB
  gauge; buttons for all five are always visible (numbered 1-5, with
  matching keyboard shortcuts), greyed out when locked or on cooldown
  rather than appearing/disappearing. Slash lands a delayed follow-up
  "bleed" tick ~0.9s after its initial hit; Sweep briefly reduces the
  target's effective defense. Super Scream is a self-buff (12s window)
  rather than a direct attack: it grants a rotation bonus (+25%) on any
  ability landed during that window (Attack itself is unaffected). Every
  ability use triggers a short, never-fails timing meter — a hit in the
  final stretch adds a damage bonus, a miss (or no input) still resolves
  the ability at its normal value; the log line says so ("Perfect
  timing!") on a hit, and the meter takes a Space/Enter press as well as
  a click. Attack/Item/Flee also gained key-hint labels
  (`(a)`/`(i)`/`(f)`), and Flee now additionally responds to `f`/`F`
  alongside the existing `Escape`. Multi-enemy targeting is explicitly
  out of scope for this phase — today's battles remain one monster at a
  time; Slash/Sweep are built so a future multi-enemy pass can extend
  them without rework.
- The dungeon entrance is no longer a fixed tile. Each new save now rolls
  a random spot among the 4 corner wilderness screens' grass tiles at
  character creation (`state.dungeonEntrancePosition`); the old hardcoded
  southeast `(24, 10)` tile is gone from the map data, and southeast is
  now plain grass like the other 3 corners unless a save's roll landed
  there. Saves created before this shipped keep landing at that historical
  southeast spot unchanged, via a one-time backfill on load.
- Monster attacks now telegraph before landing: a ~1.2s wind-up bar replaces
  the old instant-fire attack, with a parry-able zone in the final 20% of
  the bar (same proportions as the ability timing meter's own sweet
  spot). Press `s` or click the bar during that window to parry — a
  successful parry fully negates the hit and reflects half the incoming
  damage straight back at the monster, bypassing its defense entirely, and
  resets the monster's attack gauge to empty — a second reward beyond the
  reflected damage; missing the window (or not attempting) resolves as an
  ordinary hit, identical to before this feature existed. No cap or cooldown on
  attempts. The wind-up runs on the same tick loop as everything else in
  battle, so Attack, Item, Flee, and abilities all stay fully usable
  while a monster winds up — parrying and managing an ability rotation at
  the same time is the intended challenge.
- Wilderness encounters can now spawn groups of 2-3 of the same monster
  instead of always a lone target. Once you've killed 10+ of a given
  monster type (tracked per-species, forever, in `state.monsterKillCounts`),
  each new encounter with that species has a 30% chance to roll a group.
  Click a monster (or cycle with Left/Right/Tab) to select your target —
  Attack and single-target abilities hit only the selected monster, while every monster
  in the group attacks independently on its own wind-up gauge. The parry
  key (`s`) is a global sweep: it parries every monster currently sitting
  in its parry window at once, regardless of which one is selected, so a
  well-timed press can parry two simultaneous attacks in one keystroke.
  Killing a monster removes it from the row and reflows the rest; if your
  selected target dies, selection auto-advances to the next survivor.
  Fleeing a partially-cleared group banks full rewards (gold/xp/quest and
  kill-count credit) for each monster already killed and nothing for the
  survivors. Solo encounters are unaffected — same single-monster flow as
  before.
- Ability rotation redesign: Sweep now hits every living monster in the
  fight with full damage (plus its existing defense-shred debuff) instead
  of just the selected one, giving it a clear role as the group-fight
  ability now that groups exist. Stab and Chop, and Slash and Sweep, are
  now paired combo lanes — landing the setup (Stab or Slash) primes its
  payoff (Chop or Sweep) for a 1.5x damage bonus and lets it fire even
  before the swing timer is full, both via its button and its number-key
  shortcut; landing the payoff returns a smaller 1.15x bonus to the setup
  in turn, so the lane keeps feeding itself if you alternate. A primed
  ability's button glows and relabels itself ("Combo Ready" / "Bonus
  Ready") so the loop is visible without reading the log. The ability
  timing meter also now shows a "Press Space!" label once its fill enters
  the sweet spot, since that key (not the ability's own number key again)
  is what the meter actually listens for.
- Ability buttons now show an icon and a live estimated damage number
  (e.g. "🪓 Chop (2) ~18"), computed against the currently-selected
  target from an average damage roll plus any active buff/combo bonus —
  crit and timing-meter luck are deliberately excluded since those can't
  be known before pressing. The number updates automatically as you
  switch targets or a combo primes (`estimateAbilityDamage` in
  `js/systems/abilities.js`). Super Scream, a buff rather than a direct
  hit, shows no number. Pressing any ability also triggers a brief
  scale/brighten flash on its own button.
- The start/title screen got its first real visual pass: a dusk-toned
  background scene behind the save-slot panel, a scatter of monster
  emoji (including the dragon) gently floating in the sky, and a
  tree/mountain emoji horizon along the bottom — all pure CSS and emoji,
  no image assets, matching the battle screen's existing gradient-scene
  approach (`.battle-screen-forest`/`-cave`). The save-slot panel itself
  is unchanged functionally, just restyled as a translucent card
  (`.start-panel`) over the scene, and the title got an embossed
  `text-shadow` treatment. The decorative layer is `pointer-events: none`
  so it never intercepts clicks. Confirmed a page refresh already always
  lands here (`mountStartScreen()` runs unconditionally in `js/main.js`
  with no auto-continue path) — no code change was needed for that half
  of the ask.
- Damage numbers and crits got a visual pass. Every damage number is now
  a `position: fixed` element positioned from the target zone's live
  `getBoundingClientRect()` instead of an absolute child of the zone —
  so it's no longer clipped by the battle dialog's `overflow: hidden`
  and can float genuinely above it. Numbers are bigger and last longer
  (0.9s → 1.4s). A crit gets its own distinct treatment: a bigger
  gold/orange number with a glow and an entrance scale-bounce (rather
  than just a larger version of the normal float), plus a stronger
  shake across the whole dialog and a brief sway on the background
  scenery layer (`.battle-decoration`) — normal hits keep today's
  existing subtle per-zone flash/shake unchanged. Applies symmetrically
  whichever direction the crit lands, since both directions already
  share `playHitEffect`. Any damage numbers still animating get cleaned
  up on `unmount()` now that they live on `document.body` rather than
  inside the battle screen's own DOM subtree.
- A killed monster now gets its own death animation — the emoji spins
  in place (720°) while shrinking to nothing and fading out over 900ms,
  triggered the instant its HP hits 0 (`updateHpBars()` in
  `js/screens/battleScreen.js`), timed to finish right before its slot
  is hidden and (for the fight-ending kill) shortly before the dialog
  itself closes. Deliberately in-place, no sideways drift — the
  existing weak-mob flee animation shrinks *and* slides sideways, so a
  real kill now reads visually distinct from an enemy escaping.

### Fixed
- Attack-spam still trivialized fights even after the earlier fix that
  decayed its damage (floor 40%) and knockback (floor 0) per consecutive
  press — Attack has no swing-timer gate, only a flat 500ms real-time
  cooldown, so spamming it forever at 40% power twice a second was still
  likely out-DPSing the ability rotation the balance pass tuned around.
  Found via fresh playtesting. The cooldown itself now grows with the
  streak too (`attackCooldownMsForStreak` in `js/systems/combat.js`,
  `500 + streak × 200`ms, uncapped), so continuing to spam gets
  progressively slower, not just weaker, until an ability lands or the
  gauge refills (both still reset the streak as before). The 40% damage
  floor is unchanged for now — easier to tell what actually fixed it,
  and there's room to lower it further as a follow-up if needed.

### Changed
- Super Scream moved off number key `5` onto Space, and is now usable the
  instant it's off its own 30s cooldown regardless of the swing-timer
  gauge — using it no longer resets the gauge either, so it's a genuinely
  free action layered on top of the rest of the rotation rather than
  costing a turn. Digit keys `1`-`4` still map to Stab/Chop/Slash/Sweep
  unchanged.
- Attack no longer waits on the swing timer either — it's pressable any
  time — but each consecutive Attack (without landing an ability or
  letting the gauge refill to full first) deals less damage than the
  last, down to a floor of 40% of normal, with the live penalty shown
  right on the button (`Attack (a) -30%`). Landing any ability, or simply
  holding off long enough for the gauge to fill back up, resets it to
  full strength.
- Combo priming now requires actually landing the timing window, not
  just using the setup ability. Missing Stab/Slash's timing meter still
  deals normal (un-primed) damage — never-fails is unchanged — but no
  longer lights up Chop/Sweep. Chop/Sweep themselves never show the
  timing minigame at all anymore, whether triggered via a primed
  instant-cast or their own swing timer filling naturally — their
  reward is the 1.5x combo multiplier, not a stacked timing bonus on
  top of it. Landing Chop/Sweep still primes Stab/Slash's smaller
  return bonus unconditionally, since a payoff ability has no timing
  window of its own to gate on.

### Fixed
- Attack-spam exploit: spam-clicking Attack could permanently lock a
  monster out of ever attacking, since each hit's ATB knockback landed
  faster than the monster's own gauge could refill and Attack had no
  gate to slow that down. Fixed two ways: Attack now has a short flat
  500ms real-time cooldown (separate from the swing timer it's
  otherwise still free from), and the knockback itself now decays with
  the same spam streak that already decays damage — reaching exactly 0
  by the 3rd-4th consecutive hit (damage only ever floors at 40%). Once
  knockback is gone, the enemy's gauge grows uncontested regardless of
  click rate, so it's guaranteed to eventually get a turn.

### Changed
- Balance pass (Phase B, player-power side only — see
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-balance-pass-design.md`): abilities and
  leveling were both too strong, following straight from the Phase A
  simulator work that made the "too easy" complaint measurable instead of
  anecdotal. Stab's damage multiplier drops 1.3→0.8 and Chop's 1.8→1.1 (the
  early, spammable abilities that were trivializing low-tier content);
  Slash drops 1.0→0.85 and Sweep 1.5→1.3 (a lighter cut, since dungeon-tier
  was already close to a healthy difficulty for these). Attack growth for
  levels 2-9 now alternates +2/+1 per level (average +1.5, down from a flat
  +2) instead of a uniform gain every level. `xpForLevel`'s base coefficient
  rises 10→12 (20% more XP required at every level) — the "slow leveling
  down a bit" ask.
  Real effect, per the extended simulator: far-corner wilderness win rate
  stayed saturated but real attrition now shows up (HP-left dropped from
  ~84-92% to ~73-91% for a mid-tier build); `reasonable L7`'s dungeon-tier
  win rate came down from 100% to 75-78%; potion usage now shows up in
  several matchups that previously reported zero. Near-town wilderness
  (55-100 HP monsters) stayed at 100% win / 100% HP-left regardless of how
  hard abilities were cut — turns out this is structural, not
  ability-driven: a monster that slow and that squishy dies within a
  handful of player actions no matter the per-hit damage, well before its
  own wind-up ever completes, so it can't be fixed without touching monster
  HP/speed (explicitly out of scope) or crushing player power hard enough
  to break every other tier. Treated as intentional — matches the standing
  "zone 1 should keep getting easier" design call — rather than chased
  further.
  Dungeon-tier and boss-tier-0 for `prepared L9`/`veteran L11` (fully
  "prepared" builds) also proved resistant to win-rate movement even after
  stacking ability cuts with the base-attack-growth cut — real HP/potion
  cost does show up (Dragon tier 0 potions used: 0.5→1.3), but the outcome
  itself stays 100%. Decided to treat this as correct rather than a bug: a
  min-maxed "prepared" build reliably winning the content it prepared for
  is the point of preparation — attrition (HP left, potions burned) is the
  more meaningful signal for these builds, not literal win/loss. Known
  trade-off: `veteran L11` vs. Dragon tier 1 dropped from 57% (the one
  build that could previously touch it at all) to ~0-2% — an unintended
  side effect of the leveling-curve change that wasn't specifically
  protected against; left as-is rather than spending further tuning passes
  chasing a single edge-case matchup, but flagged here for anyone touching
  these numbers again.

### Fixed
- `getItemStatDelta` (`js/systems/inventory.js`) reported `enemySlowPercent
  NaN` for any gear-stat comparison against an empty equipment slot,
  since its empty-slot fallback object omitted that stat while
  `getItemEffectiveStats` always includes it — `0 - undefined = NaN`.
  Visible on both the Inventory screen's unequipped gear list and the
  new shop equip-prompt above; found while building the latter. Fixed by
  adding `enemySlowPercent: 0` to the fallback.
- Cloudflare deploy no longer ships the whole repo. The GitHub Actions
  workflow now stages just `index.html`, `css/`, and `js/` into a `dist/`
  directory and deploys that instead of the repo root, so `tests/`,
  `scripts/`, `docs/`, `package.json`, and other non-game files are no
  longer publicly fetchable from the live site.
- The post-death "Where to?" prompt (`js/screens/postDeathTravelScreen.js`)
  offered a paid warp to the dungeon entrance even when the death happened
  out in the wilderness and the player had never set foot in the dungeon.
  `promptPostDeathTravel` (`js/main.js`) now only offers the warp option
  when `state.map === 'dungeon'` at the moment of death; dying anywhere
  else shows only "Return to Town".

### Changed
- Attack's damage-decay floor (from consecutive spam) now scales down with
  how many abilities are unlocked instead of staying flat at 40% forever:
  `ATTACK_STREAK_FLOOR_PER_ABILITY` (`js/systems/combat.js`) drops the
  floor by 8 points per unlocked ability, reaching a 0% floor once all 5
  are unlocked at level 10. At level 1 (no abilities yet) the floor stays
  40%, since Attack is still the only option. A one-time-per-battle taunt
  line (`ATTACK_TAUNT_LINES` in `js/screens/battleScreen.js`) appears in
  the battle log the first time Attack's decay bottoms out at the floor,
  nudging the player toward the ability rotation instead.

### Added
- Monster kills can now drop tiered (Fine/Superior) equipment or one of
  three wholly new Unique-effect items, both weighted by how tough the
  monster is relative to the rest of the roster
  (`js/systems/itemQuality.js`'s `monsterToughness`, 0-1 by relative xp). Superior
  chance scales 2%→10% and Fine 10%→25% by toughness for an ordinary
  equipment drop (`rollQualityTier`); a separate, independent
  Unique-effect check scales 1%→5% (`rollUniqueEffectChance`), tried
  before and instead of the ordinary drop roll. Boss/elite/tool-dungeon-
  guardian monsters are fully excluded from every roll here, keeping
  their existing guaranteed drop tables untouched. The three new items
  (`js/data/items.js`): Vampiric Fang 🦴 (weapon, +7 attack, 15%
  lifesteal), Swift Strike Charm 🔮 (accessory, 10% chance of a bonus
  Attack swing that's exempt from the attack-spam-decay system and never
  itself re-rolls), and Ember Ring 🔥 (accessory, 20% chance of +6 bonus
  fire damage on hit) — all found-only, never sold. Tier/effect data
  threads through the full inventory model: `state.inventory` entries
  and `state.equipmentTiers` now carry an optional `tier`
  (`js/systems/inventory.js`), Fine/Superior multiply base stats 1.10x/
  1.20x before the existing +25%/level smith-upgrade scaling, and a
  Plain and a tiered copy of the same base item stack separately so
  equipping either one equips exactly that copy. The shop only ever
  sees/sells the Plain stack of anything it also stocks
  (`js/screens/shopScreen.js`), and the smith/inventory screens show
  each item's tier prefix in its name (`tierLabel`) alongside its normal
  stat delta. Lifesteal and the elemental proc are wired into every
  player damage source (`applyOnHitEffects`, called from `playerAttack`
  and both branches of `playerUseAbility`); the extra-swing roll wraps
  `playerAttack`'s body (extracted into `resolveOneAttack`) so a bonus
  swing fires once, at full strength, without advancing or being
  throttled by the attack-streak/cooldown decay
  (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`). Design:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-item-quality-and-effects-design.md`.
  Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-item-quality-and-effects.md`.

### Fixed
- Two stray chance-based tool drops undermined the "no chance, find it"
  tool-gating design: the wraith (Ghost Apple Supreme) carried a leftover
  `{ itemId: 'axe', chance: 0.25 }` and the orc (Super Mean Meatloaf) a
  leftover `{ itemId: 'miningPick', chance: 0.25 }` in their own
  `dropTable`s (`js/data/monsters.js`), alongside the real guaranteed
  (`chance: 1`) drops from `axeGuardian`/`pickGuardian`. The orc one had
  been missed by an earlier pass that searched for the literal string
  `'pick'`, not `'miningPick'`. Both removed — axe/pick/boat are now only
  ever obtainable from their own gated guardian fight. A new data test
  (`tests/data.test.js`) asserts no non-guardian monster carries a
  tool-type drop, so this can't silently regress.
- A mini-dungeon entrance could be revealed on a screen's only crossing
  at a narrow pass between obstacles, forcing the player through its
  interior on every single crossing, both directions, forever. Placement
  now runs a chokepoint check first (`isChokepointTile`,
  `js/systems/world.js` — a pure, DOM-free articulation-point test over
  the screen's live-passable tiles, reusable/testable on its own) via
  `js/screens/mapScreen.js`'s `isScreenChokepoint`, threaded through
  `resolveStepDiscovery`/`shouldRevealMiniDungeon`
  (`js/systems/discovery.js`, `js/systems/miniDungeons.js`); a roll that
  would have placed one there now just falls through instead.
- Leaving a tool-dungeon's interior (or the main dragon dungeon) dropped
  the player at the destination screen's generic `startPosition` instead
  of the exact entrance tile they came in through, so clearing e.g. the
  axe guardian and walking back out landed the player elsewhere on the
  screen with no immediate way to use the new tool's own shortcut.
  `enterMap` (`js/main.js`) now accepts an optional target position, and
  the `exitMap` action handler passes the real dungeon/tool-dungeon
  entrance coordinates instead of relying on the default.
- Combo-priming's timing-bonus "green zone" showed (and could be hit) on
  Stab two full levels before Chop — the ability it primes — actually
  unlocks, since Stab unlocks at level 2 and Chop at level 4. New
  `comboTimingHintUnlocked` (`js/systems/abilities.js`) hides the zone
  until the payoff ability it primes is unlocked; the timing hit is
  still scored underneath so priming works immediately once the payoff
  unlocks, only the visual was misleading.
- A primed payoff ability (e.g. Chop right after a timing-hit Stab) only
  bypassed the swing-timer/ready gate, not its own real-time cooldown —
  so if Chop was still cooling down when Stab primed it, the combo
  couldn't actually fire "right away" as designed. `canUseAbility`
  (`js/systems/abilities.js`) now bypasses both gates for a primed
  payoff; the ability button no longer shows a stale cooldown countdown
  in that state either (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`).

### Added
- Shop and Smith now show an explicit "✕" close button in the top-right
  corner, alongside (not replacing) the existing Leave button
  (`js/screens/shopScreen.js`, `js/screens/smithScreen.js`,
  `css/styles.css`'s new `.screen-close-x`) — raised 2026-08-28: "I keep
  looking for an X and not just the leave button."
- Shop, Smith, and the Quest Board now support a single-key `l` (or `L`)
  shortcut to leave the screen, alongside the existing Tab-based focus
  navigation — raised 2026-08-28: "what else could help like 'l' for
  leave or something?" Skipped while a `<select>` has focus (Smith's
  material picker) so it doesn't hijack the browser's own
  type-ahead-to-select-an-option behavior. Each screen gained real
  `pause`/`resume` lifecycle methods (matching `js/screens/mapScreen.js`'s
  own pattern) so the shortcut doesn't also fire while an unrelated HUD
  overlay (inventory, stats, etc.) is open on top of it.

### Fixed
- The Smith's Upgrade button only dimmed/disabled for missing materials,
  never for insufficient gold — raised 2026-08-28: "Fade out upgrade
  buttons if you can't afford/don't have materials. Well if you don't
  have materials already works like that so just do that for can't
  afford." `js/screens/smithScreen.js` now also disables the button when
  `state.player.gold < cost`, reusing the existing generic
  `button:disabled` fade styling.
- The persistent HUD's HP readout stayed frozen at its pre-battle value for
  the whole fight — it only synced from the battle's own live HP once, at
  `endBattle()`. `updateHpBars()` (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) now syncs
  `state.player.hp` and fires a new `onHpChange` callback the HUD wires to
  `renderHud` (`js/main.js`) every time it runs, i.e. after every
  player-HP-changing event in battle.
- Impassable mountains (`mountainWall`) rendered undersized with no
  grounding background, unlike `mountain`/`mountainCache` which already
  had that treatment — raised 2026-08-28: "Mountains look small... no
  background under them." `RANDOM_SIZE_OBSTACLES`
  (`js/screens/mapScreen.js`) had excluded `mountainWall` on a stale
  assumption that it was only the auto-sealed world-edge marker, not real
  painted terrain — 10 wilderness screens actually paint it directly via
  their own map `LEGEND` (e.g. `js/maps/wilderness/south.js`'s `'W'`).
  Adding it to that Set gives it both the same obstacle sizing and the
  grass-matched background as every other obstacle in one move, since the
  existing `map-tile-grass` class already keys off the same Set.

### Added
- Clearing a thicket/mountain with the right tool now permanently leaves a
  visible stump 🪵 or rubble 🪨 marker instead of the tile staying visually
  unchanged forever — raised 2026-08-28: "when using axe, pick and walking
  into those blocks they should get cut down and leave a stump or rubble
  or something. water should not do anything from canoe." New
  `state.clearedGates` tracks which specific tiles have been crossed;
  `js/systems/toolGates.js` gained `isGateCleared`/`markGateCleared`, and
  `js/screens/mapScreen.js`'s `tileAt()` swaps in the replacement tile via
  a `CLEARED_GATE_REPLACEMENT` map (thicket/thicketCache → stump,
  mountain/mountainCache → rubble) once cleared. Water is deliberately
  absent from that map, so canoeing across it never changes the tile.

### Added
- DOM/timing test infrastructure for screen modules, starting with
  `battleScreen.js`: `jsdom` added as the project's first-ever npm
  dependency, a shared `tests/helpers/dom.js` setup/teardown helper, and
  `tests/battleScreenDom.test.js` (9 tests) proving real button
  clicks/keyboard shortcuts/timing-minigame interactions can now be
  covered by fast automated tests instead of a live-browser round trip —
  deferred twice before (see BACKLOG_SHIPPED.md's "Testing infra" entry
  for the full history/cost tradeoff). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  gained an `npm ci` step it previously lacked (the project had zero
  dependencies before this, so `npm run test` never needed one).

### Fixed
- `attackCooldownMs` (`js/screens/battleScreen.js`) was never reset in
  `mount()`, unlike every other per-battle Attack counter next to it — a
  battle ending while Attack was mid-cooldown silently disabled Attack for
  a moment at the start of the *next* battle. Found while writing the new
  jsdom test suite above.

### Changed
- `#app`'s dim/undim transition (used by every overlay, including battle)
  now animates smoothly (`transition: filter 0.3s ease`,
  `css/styles.css`) instead of snapping instantly — a first small step
  toward the still-open "battle starts with a cool
  transition/fade" ask. See `docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md`'s "Level-up and
  general animation pass" entry for the rest of that initiative.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- New characters had no idea armor was near-mandatory: a level-1
  character with zero armor wins near-town fights 0-5% of the time
  (confirmed via the balance simulator's new no-armor baseline build);
  the one cloth piece the starting 20g affords jumps that to 97-100%.
  Working as intended by the savage-early-game design, but never
  communicated. Added a first-visit town banner that sets honest
  expectations either way — gear up first, or lean on potions and
  expect a few early deaths, which cost nothing but a trip home.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-17

First chunk of the Combat Pass backlog category.

### Added
- Potions are off the turn cooldown (drink anytime without losing your
  turn) and can occasionally crit-heal, reusing the existing attack-crit
  system instead of a new mechanic.
- Landing a hit knocks the target's ATB gauge back (`ATB_KNOCKBACK`),
  both ways — your attacks knock the enemy back, getting hit knocks you
  back. Flat and clamped at 0, not stacking, so neither side can be
  fully locked out.
- Two new items for a "faster me" / "slower them" build choice: Wind
  Greaves (legs, +4 speed) and Frost Charm (accessory, slows the
  enemy's effective speed 15% via a new `enemySlowPercent` stat that
  scales with smith upgrades like every other stat).
- A small damage bonus once the player's speed crosses a threshold
  (20, reachable through leveling and/or the new speed gear), so speed
  stays worth chasing past the point it's already fast enough to act
  often.
- Battle screen visuals: fixed the environmental decoration actually
  spreading across the background (it was one clustered text string,
  not three separate elements — `justify-content` had nothing to
  distribute), made it bigger/more visible/ground-anchored, added a
  landscape ground-tint gradient, and widened the whole battle panel.

### Changed
- `scripts/simulate-balance.js` no longer hand-rolls its own copy of
  the combat math. `js/systems/combat.js` gained
  `resolvePlayerAttack`/`resolveMonsterAttack`/`resolvePotionUse`,
  single functions covering the full crit/damage/knockback/speed-bonus/
  heal sequence, called by both the real battle screen and the
  simulator — the numbers can no longer silently drift apart the way
  they had (the simulator still had the pre-fix turn-priority bug and
  no knowledge of three new mechanics before this).

### Fixed
- Google Translate was offering to translate the page (usually as
  Spanish) despite a correct `lang="en"` — the browser's own
  content-based language detector was getting confused by a page
  that's mostly short labels/numbers/emoji with very little real
  English prose to sample. Added `<meta name="google"
  content="notranslate">` to opt out of the prompt entirely.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-17

Clears the entire Feature Requests backlog category in one pass — see
`docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md` for what's left (Combat Pass, Balance
gaps, Multi-zone, one Open Question).

### Added
- Potions can be drunk from the inventory screen outside of combat, not
  just mid-battle.
- Every non-dragon monster now has a 10% chance to drop a potion.
- Shop: sell-back at half price for any owned catalog item, with
  bulk-buy shortcuts (1x/5x/10x/100x), each disabled unless the full
  quantity is affordable.
- Quest board: a "Turn In All" button.
- Character creation: pick your hero's emoji from a curated list
  (`player.emoji`, backfilled for existing saves).
- Hover tooltips on every map tile, explaining what it is/does.
- Item tooltips everywhere an item renders (shop, inventory, smith,
  quest rewards) via a shared `describeItem()` — closes the "buying
  blind" gap as a side effect instead of a bespoke shop-only fix. Shop
  rows also mark "✓ Equipped" when applicable.
- A new "📖 Loot" HUD screen listing every item, what you own, and
  where it's obtainable (monster drops, shop, mini-dungeon treasure).
- A town well tile for free, unlimited healing outside of combat —
  deliberately not an auto-heal-on-return, to keep the potion economy
  meaningful.
- Battle screen now shows faint environmental decoration (rocks/pickaxe
  in the dungeon, trees in the wilderness) instead of a bare panel.
- Two more mini-dungeon layouts (3 → 5 variants), cutting how often
  cave discoveries repeat the same layout.

### Fixed
- The enemy's attack was blockable indefinitely: once the player's own
  ATB gauge became ready, the enemy could never attack until the player
  spent their turn — a player could sit on a full gauge forever and
  never get hit. The enemy now attacks purely on its own timer.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- First kill and every level-up now trigger a celebration effect (emoji
  burst + flavor banner), via a new screen-independent
  `js/screens/celebrationEffect.js`. First kill is a one-shot flag,
  correctly backfilled for existing characters so it doesn't misfire on
  a save that's already made progress.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Buttons across the whole game now have real styling (background,
  border, rounded corners, hover/active/disabled states) instead of bare
  default browser buttons, and overlay panels / shop / smith / quest /
  start screens use much more of the viewport (`min(90vw, 720px)`
  instead of a fixed 480px) so they no longer look tiny on a large
  monitor. Inner scroll areas (message log, inventory) now cap at 55vh
  instead of a fixed 320px for the same reason.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- Boss rematch prompt: "Not yet" previously meant "decline the tier
  escalation, but fight anyway" — once a player was already at max
  tier there was nothing to decline, so the same button silently
  started a fight. Buttons are now honest: Fight always fights, Not
  yet always walks away with no fight, New Game+ unchanged.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Equipment upgrades are now capped at `MAX_UPGRADE_LEVEL = 3` — gear
  could previously be upgraded indefinitely, removing any incentive to
  switch to a new drop.
- The boss rematch prompt now shows which dragon difficulty tiers have
  actually been cleared (stars), now that tier progress only advances on
  a real win.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- Boss rematch: `state.bossTier` previously advanced the moment an
  escalation prompt was accepted, before the fight was even fought — a
  loss never rolled it back, so you could lose a tier and still
  "progress" past it. Now only advances on an actual win.
- Inventory panel could grow past the viewport with a long item list,
  pushing the Close button out of reach with no way to scroll to it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

Retrospective baseline covering everything built before changelog
tracking started. Not a granular per-commit history — see
`docs/superpowers/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/specs/` for the full
design docs behind each of these.

### Added
- Core loop: emoji-based single-hero RPG — grid overworld, emoji-triggered
  battles, town shop/smith, one dungeon with a boss.
- World expansion: single overworld map replaced by a 3x3 grid of linked
  screens around Town, difficulty rising with distance from Town.
- Battle screen v2: hit feedback (flash/shake/floating damage numbers),
  visible ATB gauges, full scrollable combat log, win/loss pause.
- Terrain density pass: each wilderness screen quadrupled in size with
  distinct layouts, plus first-visit flavor-text banners.
- Boss rematch: opt-in escalating dragon difficulty tiers (capped),
  bigger XP reward per tier.
- Loot caches: ambient chance of finding a small gold/item stash on
  wilderness tiles, each tile marked once found.
- Mini-dungeons: rare discoverable nested sub-maps with their own
  encounters and exit back to the overworld.
- Silly monster names: goofy display names for trash monsters (boss
  keeps its serious name).
- Save slots & New Game+: named multi-slot saves plus a repeatable,
  capped NG+ mode (keep character power, reset world, tougher/better
  rewards).
- Inventory & equipment screen: view unequipped gear, manually choose
  what to equip, compare stats before swapping; auto-equip removed.
- Metroidvania tool-gating: mining pick and axe, dropped by dungeon-tier
  monsters, permanently unlock hand-picked shortcuts/loot pockets in the
  existing wilderness.
- Player growth curve rework: tapered post-level-10 stat gains, steeper
  XP curve, and partial (not full) heal on level-up past that point, to
  stop late-game trivialization.
- Quest board: repeatable quests for specific monster types, rewarding
  guaranteed upgrade materials instead of gold/XP.
- Savage early game: near-town monsters made genuinely threatening,
  armor stops being optional, the near-town → far-corner → dungeon →
  dragon escalation holds throughout.
- Comeback mechanic, status log & hero revival: escalating free potions
  on a losing streak (capped, resets on a win), a scrollable in-memory
  status log fed by every flavor banner, and a green revival-pulse
  animation on defeat.
