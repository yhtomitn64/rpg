  // Retuned 2026-09-05 to a real per-tool target level, replacing the

  // target user having got to like level 5 and tune that boss for that.
  // Then for pick I think a few levels more than that and then canoe more
  // than that." axeGuardian(L5)/pickGuardian(L7)/boatGuardian(L9) each got
  // their own attack/defense pass, not just more HP - axe and pick used to
  // share an identical stat block despite now targeting different levels,
  // so they diverge for the first time here.
  //
  // Numbers came from a throwaway Monte Carlo script built on the real
  // js/systems/combat.js|abilities.js|parry.js functions (same approach as
  // scripts/simulate-balance.js), run against Timothy's own real telemetry
  // gear at each target level - not hand-guessed. Important calibration
  // caveat found while doing this: the simulator's simulated player has
  // zero reaction latency (acts every single 300ms tick, no hesitation),
  // which makes its win-rate/HP-remaining output systematically optimistic
  // - a real level-7 player's logged axeGuardian fight (old stats) ran
  // ~2x longer and ended at 78% HP where the simulator would have shown
  // ~99% for the identical matchup. So every number below was tuned to
  // land around 48-53% average HP remaining *in the simulator* for a
  // well-geared build (several potions burned, 7-15s), deliberately well
  // below a "comfortable" simulator result, expecting real play to run
  // harder still. A deliberately under-geared player at the same level
  // (starter/base Iron, no upgrades, no accessory) loses these fights
  // outright rather than scraping by - gearing up before attempting one
  // now actually matters.

  // every existing build - see task-14-report.md for both full simulator
  // passes:
  //   1st pass (reverted): held attack/defense fixed at the candidate's own
  //   70/30 and swept hp down to 1050 to hit a 15-30% HP-remaining target.
  //   Review caught that this made the "hardest fight in the game" measure
  //   out WEAKER than the already-shipping Dragon tier 1 (1200hp/73atk/
  //   28def) and tier 2 (2400/91/34) - holding attack/defense fixed forced
  //   hp down to a small number because 70 attack vs. the maxed build's 43
  //   defense only left the player ~6 unparried hits of survival budget,
  //   turning the fight into a parry coin-flip instead of a grueling wall.
  //   2nd pass (this one): held hp >= 3000 (comfortably above Dragon tier
  //   2's 2400) and swept attack/defense DOWN instead (55/24, vs. the
  //   maxed build's 41atk/43def - a much smaller damage-per-hit, buying
  //   real survival time across a genuinely high HP pool). Converged to
  //   hp: 3000, attack: 55, defense: 24 - the maxed Mythic L12 (NG+2,
  //   +rings) build (79hp/41atk/43def, every slot Mythic+3, both
  //   superboss-only rings) lands 10% win rate / 17% avg HP remaining on a
  //   win / 6.0 of 6 potions used (5000 trials, 0% stalemateRate) -
  //   meaningfully BELOW its 18% win rate against Dragon tier 1 (so this
  //   really is the harder fight), within the spec's 15-30% band, with
  //   maxed-out potion use and a real ~90% loss rate. "veteran L11 (full
  //   iron)" and the Mythic-no-rings variant both still lose outright
  //   (0%). Sanity-checked across pickMonsterVariant's +/-15% roll range
  //   (defense untouched, hp/attack scaled together): Puny lands ~100%
  //   win, Savage ~0% - a wide swing, but the same qualitative shape every
  //   guardian already has today under this same variant system (not a
  //   new gap this task introduced - see task-14-report.md for the full
  //   numbers and discussion). NG+1/NG+2: the maxed build cannot beat this
  //   fight once IT is also NG+1/NG+2-scaled (0% at both cycles) - flagged
  //   in task-14-report.md as a real, separate finding about the
  //   post-NG+1 game overall rather than something this task's scope
  //   covers fixing.
  //
  //   Post-review addendum: the variant-roll sanity check above is now
  //   purely historical context, not live behavior - a later fix in this
  //   same branch exempted every forceFullBattle monster (this one and all
  //   four tool guardians) from pickMonsterVariant entirely (see
  //   js/systems/monsterVariants.js's pickVariantOverrides), so
  //   superBossOne's stats above are exactly what a real encounter always
  //   uses, never +/-15% varied.
