// system - just enough to name a fixed state and reach it via a URL
// param instead of hand-pasting a console script each time. Each one is
// a full js/state.js-shaped state object (every field createNewGame()
// would set), so it needs no migrations and works with every screen
// exactly like a real save - the only thing "fake" about it is how it
