// need a browser. Against this list it's a plain deepEqual on numbers, and

// contained swap rather than a second rewrite.

// Ops carry world tile coordinates (gx, gy) plus geometry in tile-local
// space, never screen pixels - so the list is independent of where the
// camera happens to be, and a smooth (fractional) camera offset is purely
// the painter's business.
