// this, a player who already owns every tool and has already cleared every
// tool gate keeps both across an NG+ reset, walking straight to the
// dungeon entrance with none of zone 1's tool-gated obstacles in the way.
// Both inventory and clearedGates reset together (Timothy's call,
// 2026-08-29) so NG+ reproduces the exact same reachability graph a
// brand-new save starts with - re-fighting each tool guardian already works
// with zero extra code (the guardian tile has no "already defeated" flag),
