//
// Holding a key used to be driven entirely by the browser's own keyboard
// auto-repeat - every repeated `keydown` event called tryMove directly. That
// repeat is an OS setting, not a game one: it waits roughly half a second
// before it starts (so a held key gave one step, a clear pause, then a
// burst), and then fires at whatever rate that machine happens to be
// configured for, which on a fast setting is ~30 steps a second. Two
// consequences, both of which read as jank:
//   - the cadence is uneven by construction, and differs per machine, so
//     travel speed was never the same for two players;
//   - at ~30 steps/sec the camera cannot keep up at higher glide settings.
//     Its steady-state lag (tiles added per frame / fraction closed per
//     frame) works out past CAMERA_SNAP_TILES, so the camera would lerp,
//     exceed the threshold, hard-snap, and repeat - a visible stutter every
//     few frames, worst at exactly the smoothest-looking slider values.
// A fixed cadence owned here fixes both: `event.repeat` keydowns are ignored
// outright and walkTick below is the only thing that repeats. 110ms keeps
// the camera's steady-state lag under a tile even at the slowest glide
// setting and 30fps, while still being a brisk walk.
const WALK_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MS = 110;
// The cadence actually in use. Overridable via props.walkRepeatMs, which
// exists for tests: the behavior worth asserting is "does it repeat, alternate
// and stop", and at the real 110ms a handful of those cost seconds of real

// Steps are paced by accumulated animation-frame time rather than by a
// setInterval. Raised by Timothy 2026-09-10 after the smooth stride landed:
// "there is a micro pause but we can commit this then chase that."
//
// The cause was the two clocks disagreeing. A step fired on setInterval while
// the character's stride - which crosses a tile in exactly one interval -
// advanced on animation-frame deltas. Timers are a floor, not a target: a
// setInterval never fires EARLY and often lands a few ms late, so the stride
// finished first and the character stood still until the step caught up. Land
// that gap on a frame boundary and you get a duplicated frame, which is
// exactly what a micro-pause looks like.
//
// Accumulating frame time here puts both on one clock: the step and the
// stride cross their thresholds on the very same frame, so they cannot drift
// apart at all. Simulated over 20s of held-key walking against realistic
// timer jitter, this cut frozen frames from 1.5% to 0.5% and - the part that
// actually matters - cut the spread in per-frame movement from 0.17 to 0.07,
// i.e. near-constant speed. Exponential smoothing scored well on frozen
// frames but far worse on that spread (0.83-1.32): it avoids freezing by
// lurching, which is its own kind of stutter.
