// The canvas map renderer - one <canvas> the size of the viewport, redrawn
// whole from a draw list (js/systems/mapDrawList.js) inside a
// requestAnimationFrame loop.
//
// Why this exists: sliding ~1200 populated CSS-Grid tiles via `transform`
// hits a real ceiling in Chrome's paint pipeline. Six specific mechanisms
// were each tested live in DevTools and ruled out one at a time before this
// was written - see docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md's two "Map render
// performance" sections for the full elimination log. A step here costs one
// bitmap paint of viewport size no matter how far the camera moved, which is
// the property the DOM version couldn't have.
//
// Deliberately canvas2d rather than WebGL or an engine: ~900 sprites a frame
// is 1-2ms of canvas2d against a 16ms budget, and WebGL has no path API at
// all, which would make the trail (per-stroke gradients along variable-width
// quadratic curves) harder rather than easier. The draw-list seam keeps a
// WebGL painter a contained swap if that ever stops being true.

// Timothy, on the build that did that: "it's really really choppy in the
// outside world ... in town is smooth but outside world with all those paths
// is pretty bad."
//
// The correctness trick is the clip. Redrawing a cell repaints its ground,
// which would erase anything overhanging into it from a neighbour drawn later
// in row-major order - that is exactly the bug the 3x3 live block had. So:
// clip to the rectangle whose pixels may legitimately change, then redraw a
// LARGER region around it in proper row-major order. The larger region
// supplies every neighbour that paints into the clipped area, and the clip
// guarantees nothing outside it is touched. Both bounds come from
// PATCH_BLEED_TILES above.

//   - draw:  the cells that must be consulted, = dirty + bleed, because a
