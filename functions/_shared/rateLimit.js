// Shared per-IP rate limiter for functions/api/save/*, backed by the same
// SAVES KV namespace those routes already need (no extra provisioning).
//
// Raised 2026-09-09: with only a 4-char save code (36^4 ~= 1.68M
// combinations) as the sole credential on the device-code path, and no
// second secret (deliberately - Timothy wants the code short, not a long
// thing to remember), the only real defense against a script sweeping
// every possible code to overwrite/delete saves is throttling request
// volume. This isn't a hard security boundary (KV reads/writes aren't
// atomic, so a concurrent burst can slip a few requests past the count,
// and a distributed attacker with many IPs isn't slowed at all) - it's a
// deterrent sized for "keep a casual single-script sweep impractical,"
// matching this feature's own low-stakes threat model.
//
// `keyPrefix`/`identifier` added 2026-09-14 for the email-OTP cloud save
// feature (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-email-otp-cloud-save-design.md):
// its three routes (send/push/redeem) each need their own isolated
// counter rather than sharing one bucket keyed only on IP - `send`
// additionally needs a per-recipient counter (an HMAC of the email, not
// an IP) so an attacker rotating IPs can't bypass a per-victim cap. Both
// default to today's exact behavior, so every existing call site is
// unaffected.
