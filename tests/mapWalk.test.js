// Tests for held-key continuous movement (js/screens/mapScreen.js's
// WALK_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MS / walkTick).
//
// Raised by Timothy 2026-09-10: "if you hold down up/left/right/down it's
// kind of janky and not smooth... if you hold down character should walk
// fast just smoothly." Holding a direction used to be driven entirely by the
// browser's own keyboard auto-repeat, which waits ~half a second before it
// starts and then fires at whatever rate that machine is configured for - so
// a held key gave one step, a pause, then a machine-dependent burst, and
// travel speed was never the same for two players. A fixed cadence owned by
// mapScreen replaces it, and `event.repeat` keydowns are ignored outright.
//
// These use real timers rather than mocked ones on purpose: the thing under
// test IS the timing behavior, and mapScreen's interval is real. Waits are
// kept short and assertions are ranges, not exact step counts, so ordinary
// scheduler jitter can't make them flaky.

// The cadence these tests run the walk at, deliberately far below the game's
// own 110ms (WALK_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MS in mapScreen.js). Every wait below is
// expressed as a multiple of it, so the intent survives a change to either
// number. What's under test is that the walk repeats, alternates and stops -
// not the exact speed - and Node runs test files in parallel, so seconds spent
// genuinely asleep here are enough to starve other timing-sensitive suites
// (caught making an unrelated battle test flake). mount() takes the cadence as
// a prop for exactly this reason.
//
// Kept comfortably above one animation frame: steps are paced by accumulated
// frame time now (see the walkFrame comment in mapScreen.js), and jsdom's own
// frames land around 16ms, so a cadence near that would quantise unevenly and
// make the step counts below jittery for reasons that have nothing to do with
// the behavior under test.
