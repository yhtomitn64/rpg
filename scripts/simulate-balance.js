/**
 * Dungeon-tier & boss balance simulation.
 *
 * Drives the REAL combat/leveling/inventory/abilities/boss-tier modules
 * (`js/systems/combat.js`, `js/systems/leveling.js`, `js/systems/inventory.js`,
 * `js/systems/abilities.js`, `js/systems/bossTiers.js`) and the REAL monster and
 * item data, replaying `battleScreen.js`'s tick loop headlessly so the numbers
 * here reflect the shipped mechanics rather than a re-implementation.
 *
 * This lives in `scripts/` (not `tests/`) on purpose: `npm test` globs
 * `tests/*.js`, and this is a stochastic balance report with no pass/fail
 * assertions, so it must not run as part of the test suite.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/simulate-balance.js
 *   node scripts/simulate-balance.js --trials 5000
 *   node scripts/simulate-balance.js --set orc.attack=20 --set wraith.hp=32
 *   node scripts/simulate-balance.js --parry-rate 0.5
 *
 * `--set` applies a temporary in-memory stat override, which is how candidate
 * retunes were explored before being written into `js/data/monsters.js`.
 *
 * KEEP THIS IN SYNC: this file used to hand-roll its own copies of the
 * combat formulas and quietly fell behind real fixes for a long stretch
 * before anyone noticed (see the 2026-08-17 fix that made it call the real
 * combat.js functions instead) - and it was blind to the entire ability
 * system for just as long after abilities shipped (see the 2026-08-22
 * balance-simulator-ability-modeling plan that added ability/combo/boss-tier
 * modeling here, months later). When you change `js/systems/combat.js`,
 * `js/systems/abilities.js`, `js/systems/bossTiers.js`, or add a new combat
 * mechanic anywhere in the battle system: check whether `simulateBattle()`
 * below and `scripts/simulateAbilityPolicy.js`'s `chooseAction()` need a
 * matching update. The *math* (damage/crit/cooldowns/combo bonuses) stays
 * in sync automatically as long as this file keeps calling the real shared
 * functions instead of reimplementing them - but the *policy* (what action
 * the simulated player takes each tick) is a hand-rolled stand-in for a
 * human, and nothing enforces that it reflects a new ability, a new status
 * effect, or a new player action. It has to be updated by hand, on purpose,
 * every time.

// --- CLI ---------------------------------------------------------------

// Stands in for a human's real parry-timing skill, since the simulator has
// no windup/keypress to model (monsters still attack the instant their ATB
// is ready - simulateBattle rolls this chance instead, gated by the same
// PARRY_COOLDOWN_MS cooldown the real game now uses, see its
// isReady(monster.atb) branch below). Every number this file produced before
// 2026-09-01 assumed a player who never lands a single parry, which is a
// known conservative bias, not just an oversight - see the 2026-08-31/
// 2026-09-01 backlog entry ("Parry window trade-offs") in
// docs/superpowers/BACKLOG.md for why this was finally added. 0.3, not
// TIMING_HIT_RATE's 0.7, because the parry window (js/systems/parry.js) was
// narrowed the same session specifically so landing one takes real skill -
// at 0.7 (the old window's implied rate) several dragon-tier/NG+2 matchups
// that are unwinnable at 0 parries flip to 84-100% win rate; at 0.3 the
// hardest fights barely move while easier ones still burn fewer potions.
// Override via --parry-rate on the CLI to explore other assumptions - this
// default is a judgment call to recheck against real play, same as
// TIMING_HIT_RATE's own commentary above. Threaded explicitly through
// runMatchup/simulateBattle rather than a shared mutable module variable, so
// a future report run could compare two rates side by side in one process.

// flat rate made every superboss look far harder in this file than in real

 * Replays battleScreen.js's tick loop. The actual combat math (damage, crit,
 * knockback, speed bonus, heal, ability scaling) is NOT reimplemented here - it calls
 * resolvePlayerAttack/resolveMonsterAttack/resolvePotionUse/resolveAbilityUse from
 * js/systems/combat.js and js/systems/abilities.js, the exact same functions
 * battleScreen.js calls, so this script's numbers can't silently drift from the
 * shipped mechanics the way they did before 2026-08-17 (this file used to hand-roll
 * the same formulas, and quietly fell behind a battleScreen.js turn-priority fix
 * and three new combat-pass mechanics before anyone noticed).
 *
 * What's modeled here via real code (not reimplemented):
 *   - Ability rotation policy via chooseAction from simulateAbilityPolicy.js
 *   - Lacerate's self-retrigger buff (stand-in success rate, same as the old combo-timing model)
 *   - Buff state (duration, active/inactive)
 *   - Defense debuff application and ticking (Sweep's shred effect)
 *   - Attack streak multiplier/knockback scaling
 *   - All potion and ability cooldown management
 *   - Rung-3 gear on-hit effects (crit% bonus, extra-swing chance, lifesteal,
 *     elemental proc, thorns reflect) - added 2026-08-31 so a build with
 *     Vampiric Fang/Swift Strike Charm/Ember Ring/Keen Eye/Retribution
 *     Charm/Windfury Ring can actually be measured instead of only its flat
 *     stats. Mirrors battleScreen.js's playerEffectBonuses/
 *     applyOnHitEffects exactly - see makeBuild() and applyOnHitEffects()
 *     below.
 *   - A superboss's specialAttacks (slow/cooldownOverload) - added
 *     2026-09-05 (Task 8 of the superboss-pass plan) so a boss's kit isn't
 *     silently invisible to this file's numbers. Rolled via combat.js's
 *     shared rollSpecialAttack (the exact function battleScreen.js's
 *     windup-start roll now also calls) at the same point this file already
 *     resolves a monster's turn - see the isReady(monster.atb) block below.
 *     'stun' has NO simulator-side model (see that block's own comment) -
 *     a known conservative gap, flagged in this file's report output too.
 *
 * What's still hand-rolled here (AI policy layer, not combat math): the
 * "drink a potion when below 40% HP" decision and the potion cooldown loop
 * structure. That's an AI stand-in for human clicking and has no real
 * battleScreen.js equivalent to share.
 *
 * What's deliberately NOT modeled (known scope limits):
 *   - Slash's delayed bleed tick from its buff state
 *   - The parry wind-up itself (monsters still attack the instant their ATB
 *     is ready in this simulation) - but a landed parry's outcome IS now
 *     modeled as cooldown-gated (PARRY_COOLDOWN_MS, js/systems/parry.js):
 *     an attempt is only possible once off cooldown, rolling parryLandRate
 *     as a stand-in for a human's windup-timing skill the same way
 *     TIMING_HIT_RATE stands in for ability-timing skill, and the cooldown
 *     starts whether or not that roll succeeds (see PARRY_LAND_RATE_DEFAULT
 *     below and --parry-rate in parseArgs). A superboss's specialAttacks
 *     are rolled and resolved in that same single step, since there's no
 *     multi-tick windup here to roll at the *start* of and resolve later
 *     the way battleScreen.js's pendingSpecialAttack does.
 *   - A monster special attack's 'stun' type - see the isReady block below.
